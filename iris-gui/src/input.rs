//! Translate egui keyboard / pointer events into iris PS2 controller writes.
//!
//! ## Mouse / keyboard capture
//!
//! The guest's PS/2 mouse is *relative*: it reports motion deltas, and IRIX
//! draws its own pointer with its own acceleration. There is no way to keep a
//! relative guest pointer pixel-aligned with a visible host cursor — they
//! drift. So we adopt the standard emulator model (mirroring `src/ui.rs`):
//! **click the framebuffer to capture.** On capture we hide the host cursor
//! and lock it in place (`CursorGrab::Locked`); raw motion then arrives as
//! `egui::Event::MouseMoved` deltas (eframe forwards `DeviceEvent::MouseMotion`
//! regardless of grab), which we feed straight to the guest. Only the guest's
//! own pointer is visible, so there is nothing to misalign. **Ctrl+Alt+Esc
//! releases** (Alt is the Option key on macOS); a chord rather than bare Esc
//! so plain Esc still reaches the guest.
//!
//! While captured we also forward keyboard input to the guest; while *not*
//! captured we forward nothing, so menu clicks and typing into the config
//! side panel stay with egui.
//!
//! The framebuffer panel calls `pump(...)` each frame with the rect the REX3
//! image occupies in screen space (used only to decide where a capturing
//! click counts).
