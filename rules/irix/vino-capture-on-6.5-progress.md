# VINO capture on IRIX 6.5.22 — campaign progress

Companion to [indycam-end-to-end-capture.md](indycam-end-to-end-capture.md)
(which got capture working on **IRIX 5.3**). This note covers making it work
on **6.5.22**, where it currently does NOT fully work yet.

---
## ★ START HERE (next-session handoff, 2026-05-30) ★

**Status: ★ SOLVED + CLEAN IMAGE (cont. 15–16) ★** — `vidtomem` delivers a **clean,
correctly-coloured 640×480 SMPTE-bar frame** on IRIX 6.5, reproducibly (no hang, no
scramble). First successful end-to-end IndyCam capture on 6.5. FOUR fixes in
`src/vino.rs` + a fast-exchange fix in `src/iris_ci_main.rs` (all uncommitted on
`vino-6.5-capture-engage`, alongside committed physical.rs alias 8426efd). Read cont. 16
(latest) then 15. The vino.rs fixes:
1. **`dma_emit_dword` defer** (delivery): interlaced first field (`field_counter==0`)
   defers STOP/DESC (EOF only); 2nd field completes (EOF+DESC+disable). → parity odd,
   `conn+0xb8` clears.
2. **`read_channel_reg` CH_DESC_TABLE_PTR = base+0x780 on 2nd field** (delivery): the
   kernel's field-boundary descriptor (`*(bufentry+0x10)`); makes `0x77c0` return 1 so
   `0x7640` doesn't abort → `0x60b4` delivers + clears `conn+0xc` → wakeup → frame.
3. **`shift_descriptors` JUMP `& 0x3FFF_FFF0`** (geometry): 16-byte-align the jump-bug
   JUMP target (strips its +4 offset) so all 300 data pages land in order — was
   scrambling via `& 0x3FFF_FFFF`.
4. **`render_and_pump` Rgba32 emits A,B,G,R** (colour): VINO RGB is A,B,G,R; emitting
   A,R,G,B swapped red↔blue.

`iris-ci get`/`put` also fixed (shell-aware: detect sh vs csh) so the scratch-volume
pull works fast (~1.8s) on the sh-root klindert disk; this is also why `iris-ci run`
had been printing `guest exit -1` (csh `$status` empty under sh).

**FOLLOW-UPS (not blockers):** (a) `FIELD_DESC_SPAN=0x780` is constant, tuned for
640×480 — derive from clip height for other geometries. (b) 5.3 regression: the
geometry+colour fixes now affect 5.3's interlace path too — verify stock vidtomem still
saves a correct frame on the 5.3 guest. (c) commit. (d) any residual sub-pixel artifact
not chased — the bars/ramp look clean.

**Committed/shipped (safe, keep):**
- VINO bit-30 descriptor-pointer strip (`desc::PTR_MASK = 0x3FFF_FFF0` in
  `src/vino.rs`). Makes 6.5 capture engage + DESC fire. 5.3-neutral. This
  REPLACES the earlier `src/physical.rs` `alias_phys()` (commit `8426efd`):
  the `0x4000_0000` accesses were VINO DMA, not the CPU, and there is no RAM
  alias there on real hardware — the bit-30 JUMP control flag must be stripped
  in VINO, not aliased across the whole physical bus. See "Fix #1" below.
- Boot speed 292s→89s on the klindert guest (nsswitch files-first + FQDN + service
  disables) — see [[project_klindert_boot_speed]]. `src/vino.rs` is at HEAD.

**THE delivery path (unified — cont. 6 and cont. 11 are the SAME gate):** videod's
worker blocks in the kernel `vinoGetFrame` on `sleep(conn,0x13c)` (0x118&8==0 ⇒
blocking mode), woken by the only `wakeup(conn)` (in `vinoFinishDMA`). `vinoFinishDMA`
runs from the self-rescheduling timer `vinoWakeupTimeout` ONLY when `*(conn+0xc)==0`
(else it reschedules forever; live `*(conn+0xc)=0x0861e000`, never cleared). The EOF
finalizer `0x60b4` both enqueues the frame (vinoFillInfo/dms_fifo_enq) AND clears
`*(conn+0xc)` (0x6360) — but ONLY if it reaches its delivery tail. So: **0x60b4
reaching its tail is the one gate; it both delivers and unblocks `vinoGetFrame`.**

**Why 0x60b4 is blocked, and the REAL gate (cont. 12):** 0x60b4's tail needs
`byte0x133==0 OR 0x118&1==0 OR word@0xd0 parity ODD`. `0x118` and `byte0x133` come
straight from videod's `copyin`'d VL request (`vinoSetupGetFrame`: `0x118=*(s1+0x3a)`,
`byte0x133=(*(s1+0x38)&4)`) — iris CANNOT change them and real HW sends the same
(`0x118=0x27`,`0x133=1`). So real HW delivers via **parity ODD**. The parity writer
`0x7640` computes `*(conn+0xd2)`; in mode `0x118&3==3` it has TWO branches:
- `conn+0xb8 != 0` → `field_counter + (field_counter&1)` = **always EVEN** (dead).
- `conn+0xb8 == 0` AND `(field_counter - conn+0xc0)==1` → `field_counter + prev_parity`
  = **ALWAYS ODD** (delivers). `conn+0xc0`/`conn+0xbc` are the previous field's
  counter/parity, saved by the prior `0x7640`.

`conn+0xb8` is the "first field after a DMA (re)start" flag: SET to 1 on every DMA
arm/restart (0x5028, 0x6ae8), CLEARED by the first field's `0x7640`. So a clean
two-field frame delivers on **field 2** (0xb8 cleared by field1, delta==1 ⇒ odd).

**iris ROOT CAUSE:** iris hits a STOP descriptor and **disables DMA every field**
(`vino.rs:588`, the per-field rewind at `vino.rs:707` + per-row interleave skip make
the cursor reach STOP each field). The kernel then re-arms DMA every field, setting
`conn+0xb8=1` EVERY field → `0x7640` always takes the EVEN branch → parity never odd
→ `0x60b4` never reaches its tail → `*(conn+0xc)` never clears → videod never woken.

**THE FIX (IMPLEMENTED in `dma_emit_dword`, `src/vino.rs`):** model one DMA-enable
cycle as one interlaced frame. `field_counter` is 0 for the cycle's first field (reset
in `start_channel`) and >=1 after. When the DMA cursor reaches a STOP descriptor, if
`interleave && field_counter == 0` (the FIRST field), DO NOT raise DESC and DO NOT
disable DMA — just end the field's pump (EOF still fires in `pump_field`). The SECOND
field (`field_counter>=1`) reaches STOP and raises EOF+DESC + disables DMA as before.
So INTR goes **0x01 on the even/first field, 0x05 on the odd/second** instead of 0x05
every field. The kernel then restarts capture once per frame (not per field), so
`conn+0xb8` is cleared by the first field and is 0 at the second field's EOF; delta==1
holds (consecutive `field_counter` 0→1 within the cycle, kernel reads post-increment
1→2); parity goes ODD; `0x60b4` delivers + clears `*(conn+0xc)`; the timer
`vinoFinishDMA`→`wakeup(conn)` unblocks videod's `vinoGetFrame`.
Keyed on `field_counter==0` (not source parity) so it's robust to where the
even/odd source field lands relative to the DMA-enable boundary.
**5.3 GATE (structural):** 5.3 capture is EOF-driven and page-steps NEXT_4_DESC per
field, so it NEVER reaches a STOP descriptor in `dma_emit_dword` — this branch never
runs for 5.3. The change is also `interleave`-gated. So 5.3 delivery is untouched;
still REGRESSION-TEST it live (stock vidtomem on the 5.3 guest must still save a frame).
NOTE: the early "even=EOF, odd=EOF+DESC didn't deliver" attempt (top of doc, the
"geometry-fix attempt") PREDATES the physical.rs alias fix, so the kernel ring polling
was broken then — that test was INVALID and does NOT refute this.

**DECISIVE CHEAP VERIFY (do before/with the fix):** with the current HEAD build, read
`conn+0xb8` (byte) during a capture — expect **1** (confirms re-arm-every-field). After
the fix, read `conn+0xb8` at the odd field's EOF (expect 0) and `*(conn+0xd2)` (expect
ODD) and `*(conn+0xc)` (expect it to reach 0). icrash recipe below.

**SUPERSEDED — do NOT chase (cont. 12 corrections):** the cont. 7–11 "`*(conn+0x118)&1`
single bit" and "trace what VL format makes videod clear bit0" — `0x118` is copyin'd
from videod, normal, and real HW uses the same value; the 0x118/parity path delivers
via `conn+0xb8`, NOT via clearing bit0. cont. 10's "field_counter parity ruled out"
was WRONG to exclude parity: parity IS the gate, just driven by `conn+0xb8`+delta, not
by field_counter's own parity. cont. 8/9 EOF/DESC *split* is HARMFUL: `vinoEOD` aborts
unless EOF fired in the SAME ISR pass (`a2!=0`), so DESC must come WITH EOF on the odd
field (combined 0x05 is correct there) — the split made `a2=0` and aborted vinoEOD.
The 0x60b4 pollwakeup(0xc0)/select path is a real but SECONDARY path (videod uses
blocking sleep, not select); don't optimize for it.

**Tooling:** chaindump/chainwalk live in guest `/usr/tmp`. icrash recipe: the vino
module RELOCATES per boot, so each boot re-derive: `icrash -e 'od vino_board 1'`
→ device; `od (device+0x38) 1` → channel-A conn; `conn+0x14`=device(poll dev).
`icrash -f cmdfile` batches `od` reads. `par` needs rtmond (disabled for boot
speed — `chkconfig rtmond on` first). ALWAYS halt cleanly: `sync;halt -y; wait
~30s; iris-ci quit` (abrupt quit corrupted the root XFS once already — see
[[project_klindert_boot_speed]]). Capture: videod needs the X `:0.0` display (xdm
kept on). config `iris-klindert.toml` (6.5, vino source=test_pattern).

## 5.3-vs-6.5 differential (the key diagnostic) + geometry-fix attempt

Ran the STOCK `/usr/sbin/vidtomem` on BOTH: it **succeeds on 5.3** ("saved image
to file") and **hangs on 6.5** — so the custom client was never the issue.

Diffing the VINO register traces of the two:
- **5.3 (works):** `INTR_STATUS -> 0x01` (EOF only). videod re-programs
  `NEXT_4_DESC` per field (page-stepped blocks, e.g. 0x0852c000 → 0x0852b000),
  EOF-driven, iris never reaches a STOP descriptor.
- **6.5 (hangs):** `INTR_STATUS -> 0x05` (DESC|EOF). videod sets up a dense
  JUMP-chained descriptor table; iris follows it and hits a STOP descriptor,
  raising DESC, which 6.5's videod treats as a (half-captured) done transfer.

Attempted fix (matches MAME's contiguous model): removed the per-row interleave
skip + stride pad in `dma_emit_dword`/`render_and_pump`, and rewound the
descriptor cursor only on the even field so it flows across both fields to the
frame's STOP. Result: even fields now raise EOF (0x01) like 5.3, odd fields hit
STOP (0x05) after the full frame — but **videod still did not deliver a frame to
the client.** So the STOP/EOF timing is necessary-but-not-sufficient; the
blocker is in how 6.5's videod drives/polls the capture (it keeps re-arming per
field and never completes a client transfer). REVERTED (didn't fix 6.5, and it
touches the working 5.3 geometry).

## ROOT CAUSE (via disassembly of the 6.5 kernel vino driver)

Pulled `/var/sysgen/boot/vino.o` (ELF MIPS-III, **not stripped**) off the guest
and disassembled it with capstone (`/tmp/dv.py`). The driver has TWO
descriptor-chain builders, selected by `vinoBuildDAPS`:
`vinoBuildNormalDAPS` vs **`vinoBuildJumpBugDAPS`** — a workaround for an
early-VINO hardware bug in the **4-at-a-time DMA descriptor-cache fetch**.

`vinoBuildJumpBugDAPS` lays out descriptors so that **every 4th slot is a JUMP**
(`0x40000000 | kvtophys(next)`), and the jump target is deliberately offset by
**+4 or +8** (the +8 case skips a descriptor slot) to dodge the buggy fetch.
This is exactly the `0x4861e014`/`0x4861e024`… (`+0x14`, i.e. group+4) layout
seen in the descriptor table at `0x0861e000`.

iris's descriptor engine (`shift_descriptors`/`dma_emit_dword` in `vino.rs`)
does not replicate this jump-bug fetch/skip behavior, so it traverses the chain
incorrectly — wrong pages and/or wrong STOP timing — and the capture never
completes cleanly: iris raises DESC (`INTR_STATUS=0x05`) where 5.3's
normal-DAPS path raises EOF (`0x01`), and the `vinoWakeupTimeout` watchdog
restarts forever. 5.3's older driver always uses the normal layout, which iris
handles — hence 5.3 works.

DISPROVEN: the jump-bug path is **not** gated on board revision. Forcing MC
SYSID rev 0→3 (board_rev 3) did NOT switch the driver to NormalDAPS — the
descriptor table was still the jump-bug `+0x14` layout. The selector
(`vinoBuildDAPS` arg0 = a DMA-geometry value, not board_rev) chooses jump-bug
based on the buffer layout, so it's effectively always on for this capture.

## Next step to actually fix it

Implement correct VINO jump-bug descriptor-cache traversal in `vino.rs`:
fetch descriptors 4-at-a-time, honor JUMP (bit 30) targets as PHYSICAL
addresses with the +4/+8 group offset, and skip the dummy slot exactly as
`vinoBuildJumpBugDAPS` intends, so the chain reaches its terminating STOP only
after a full frame and the captured pages are correct. The authoritative spec
is `vinoBuildJumpBugDAPS` (0x4af4 in vino.o) — disassemble it (`python3
/tmp/dv.py vinoBuildJumpBugDAPS`) to derive the exact +4-vs-+8 condition. This
is a bounded but non-trivial emulator feature; not yet implemented.

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED (verified) + remaining videod blocker

Disassembling vino.o pinned the descriptor differential, and chainwalk on the
guest verified it numerically:
- iris/MAME follow a JUMP target unaligned (`& 0x3fffffff`). VINO actually
  fetches descriptors in **16-byte-aligned groups of four**, so the jump-bug
  workaround's +4/+8 low-bit offsets must be masked. Walking the 6.5 chain
  unaligned yields **181** data pages → premature STOP; **16-byte-aligned**
  yields exactly **300** pages = a full 640×480×4 frame.

Two fixes in `vino.rs` (both verified, NO 5.3 regression — stock `vidtomem`
still saves a frame on 5.3 with them):
1. `shift_descriptors`: mask JUMP target to `& 0x3FFF_FFF0` (16-byte align).
2. interlace geometry: drop the per-row stride skip/pad in
   `dma_emit_dword`/`render_and_pump`, and rewind the descriptor cursor only on
   the even field (`pump_field`), so the cursor flows across both fields and
   reaches the frame's STOP once per frame.

Result on 6.5: the kernel driver now gets **two EOF interrupts per frame**
(`INTR_STATUS=0x01`), exactly like 5.3 — no more premature DESC — and VINO DMA
writes a full frame to RAM (verified by reconstructing 300 pages; content
matches the live camera, including black when the camera is dark).

**BUT `vidtomem` still hangs on 6.5** — with the camera AND with test_pattern.
Since 6.5's VINO interrupt behavior now matches 5.3's (which delivers), the
remaining blocker is **in 6.5's videod daemon**, not the VINO descriptor/
interrupt layer. Leading suspect: 6.5's videod requires valid **UST/MSC frame
timestamps** (`vinoGetUSTMSCPair`/`vinoCorrectUST`/`vinoGetFrontierMSC` in
vino.o) that iris doesn't provide, where 5.3's simpler path didn't. That's the
next thing to emulate. The two vino.rs fixes are correct and worth keeping
regardless.

## DELIVERY MECHANISM (from the ISR disassembly) — the remaining piece

Disassembled `vinoInterrupt` (the ISR). On each interrupt it calls
`update_ust`/`get_ust_nano` (UST timestamp) then dispatches:
```
andi $v1, $s3, 4     ; bit 2 = CHA_DESC
beqz $v1, ...        ; if NOT desc, skip
... -> vinoEOD        ; frame delivery (vinoGetNextBuffer + fill dmrb ring)
```
So **frame delivery (`vinoEOD`) is triggered by the DESC (end-of-descriptor)
interrupt — bit 2 — NOT by EOF.** `vinoEOD` is what hands the completed buffer
to videod's dmedia ring (and `vinoFillInfo`→`dmrb_timestamp` stamps it). EOF
(bit 0) only updates the field/UST state.

This means: for a VL client to get a frame, iris must raise **exactly one DESC
per complete interleaved frame** — after BOTH fields are captured into the
300-page buffer and the cursor reaches the chain's terminating STOP descriptor.

- The **jump-align fix is necessary** (without it the chain hits STOP at 181
  pages, a malformed half frame). KEPT.
- The earlier "cursor-flow / no-skip" change was the WRONG direction: it made
  capture EOF-only (no DESC), so `vinoEOD` never fired. REVERTED.
- The right fix is an interlace-frame restructure: one DMA pass writes even
  rows (at even offsets) and odd rows (at odd offsets) across the 300-page
  buffer, raising EOF at each field boundary and **one DESC at the frame's end**
  (the STOP descriptor). iris currently pumps fields sequentially and the
  per-row interleave skip makes the EVEN field's cursor reach STOP alone
  (premature half-frame DESC). Getting exactly-one-DESC-per-frame from iris's
  field-at-a-time VideoSource is the remaining (intricate) work — NOT done.

UST is likely fine (the ISR's `get_ust_nano` runs as real kernel code over
iris's advancing timers); the blocker is the DESC/interlace-frame timing above,
not the timestamp.

## Bottom line (honest)

The `0x40000000` alias fix made VINO capture **engage** on 6.5 (DMA runs,
DESC/EOF interrupts fire, the driver reads them, camera data reaches RAM). But
**no recognizable frame has been produced yet**: (1) the VL client
(`vinograb`) never gets a frame from videod — `vlGetNextValid`/`vlGetLatestValid`
return NULL (videod isn't filling the client buffer); (2) a `/dev/mem`
reconstruction hack (`vinodump.c`) pulls the bytes out of the DMA pages but does
not correctly model the interleave + row-stride + descriptor-page geometry, so
the reassembled image is scrambled, and the colour is off (a YUV→RGB / U-V-swap
cast turns a cream wall into uniform blue-gray). A real macOS camera grab
(`/tmp/camgrab.swift`) shows the true scene for comparison; the iris output does
not match it. Do not present the current reconstruction as a faithful grab.

## Status

- Enumeration works: `vlinfo` shows `vino 0`, `extensions = EXT_camera`, the
  digital (IndyCam) + analog sources, and Memory Drain nodes. The I2C/CDMC
  camera-attach probe succeeds on 6.5 with the existing emulation.
- A VL capture program (`vinograb.c`, repo root) compiles with MIPSpro `cc`
  (`cc -o vinograb vinograb.c -lvl`), opens the path, negotiates 640×480, and
  the driver **does** program descriptors and enable DMA
  (`CONTROL <- 0xf8e`: DMA+interleave+sync+D1/camera+RGB).
- **VINO DMA actually writes captured pixels to RAM** — dumped a descriptor
  page (`0x0a658000`) mid-capture and found real ARGB data (`ffc9d6db…`).
- **But `vlGetNextValid` times out**: the driver enables DMA, doesn't get the
  completion it waits for, tears down and retries in a tight loop forever.

## Fix #1 (DONE): strip the descriptor bit-30 control flag in VINO — `src/vino.rs`

The `MC: CPU Error at 48621cf0` flood (~160k lines) was **not** a CPU access and
there is **no 0x40000000 RAM alias** on the Indy. The accesses are VINO **DMA**:
`descriptor_fetch` and the DMA buffer writes go *through* the `Physical` bus
(`Vino::set_phys`), and any unmapped address VINO drives is routed to
`CpuBusErrorDevice` — which is why it printed as a "CPU" error.

The addresses carried bit 30 because the 6.5 driver encodes descriptor/table
pointers as `JUMP_BIT | kvtophys(addr)` (`vinoBuildJumpBugDAPS`): bit 31 is STOP,
bit 30 is JUMP, and the address field is only bits `[29:4]`. The real lomem
address is in the low bits (`0x4861e000 → 0x0861e000`, in RAM at
0x08000000..0x18000000). VINO's `PTR_MASK` was `0xFFFF_FFF0`, wrongly keeping
bits 31/30, so `start_desc_ptr`/`next_desc_ptr` retained bit 30 and VINO fetched
at `0x4861e000` — off into unmapped space.

Fix (at the source): `desc::PTR_MASK = 0x3FFF_FFF0`, so the descriptor-pointer
register writes (`CH_NEXT_4_DESC`, `CH_DESC_TABLE_PTR`), the data-buffer write
address, and the JUMP target all strip the control bits and resolve to real RAM.
The JUMP target already masked `0x3FFF_FFF0`; this just makes the register path
consistent. Result: the MC error flood is **gone** (0 errors), capture engages,
and no physical-bus alias is needed.

(Superseded the earlier `alias_phys()` approach in physical.rs, which papered
over this by aliasing the *entire* 0x40000000-0x7FFFFFFF window for every device
on the bus — masking the real bug and silently redirecting any other access in
that range.)

## Client delivery is blocked at the videod level (ruled out client API)

With the alias fix, the kernel VINO driver captures continuously (~30 fps:
`channel A DMA enabled` grows by ~300 in 5 s) and the camera data reaches RAM.
But **no VL client ever receives a frame**. Tried, all fail identically:
`vlGetNextValid` poll, `vlGetLatestValid` poll, and a `vlSelectEvents` +
`vlNextEvent` loop (which blocks forever — `vlPendingEvents` doesn't exist in
this libvl). Tried source/drain node `0` and `VL_ANY` (the latter negotiates
768×576 PAL vs 640×480 NTSC — note the standard ambiguity). videod captures for
itself but never completes a *client* transfer, so vinograb gets zero frames and
zero events.

Hypotheses **tested and DISPROVEN** as the delivery blocker:
- **Interleave/descriptor geometry (STOP-after-one-field).** Disabling the
  per-row interleave skip in `dma_emit_dword` + the stride pad in
  `render_and_pump` (so a field writes contiguously, consuming half the
  descriptors like MAME, STOP after the frame) did **not** unblock delivery —
  vinograb still timed out. So the geometry only affects image *quality*, not
  whether videod delivers. (Reverted; the 5.3 geometry is unchanged.)
- **Video standard mismatch.** Default is NTSC and the camera feeds NTSC
  (640×486); node-0 capture is 640×480 NTSC and still didn't deliver. (`VL_ANY`
  negotiates 768×576 PAL but that's a separate VL-default quirk, not the cause.)
- **Client API.** poll `vlGetNextValid`, poll `vlGetLatestValid`, and
  `vlSelectEvents`+`vlNextEvent` all fail identically; node 0 and `VL_ANY` both
  fail.

**Decisive control test:** the STOCK `/usr/sbin/vidtomem` — the exact tool the
5.3 campaign confirms works — **also hangs on 6.5** (no output, no file, had to
^C it), identically to the custom `vinograb`. So the custom client was NOT the
bug; the VL capture→client path is broken on 6.5 regardless of client.

So the blocker is below the VL client — in the videod/kernel-VL/emulator
interaction on 6.5: the kernel VINO driver captures and the DESC/EOF interrupts
fire, but no frame ever reaches a VL client. It is NOT the interleave geometry
(disproven), NOT the video standard (disproven), NOT client code (disproven by
the vidtomem control test). Root cause below the client is UNDIAGNOSED — likely
needs comparing 5.3 (works) vs 6.5 (hangs) videod behaviour at the
register/ioctl level, since 5.3 capture works through the same iris VINO/CDMC.

## Root cause of the remaining timeout (NOT yet fixed)

The 6.5 driver waits for the **end-of-descriptor (DESC / `ISR_CHA_DESC`)
interrupt**, which fires when DMA consumes a descriptor with the STOP bit. The
driver lays out a long descriptor chain (3 page-ptrs + a JUMP per 16-byte
group, advancing `0x10` per jump) that ends in a region of `0x80000001` STOP
descriptors (seen at `0x08621400`).

iris's `pump_field()` (`src/vino.rs`) **rewinds to a fixed `start_desc_ptr` at
the start of every field and never advances it**, so it re-traverses the same
front of the chain each field and never reaches the STOP descriptors → the DESC
interrupt never fires → the driver never sees completion.

MAME's `vino_device::end_of_field` (`../mame/src/mame/sgi/vino.cpp`) is the
reference: after the **odd** field it does `start_desc_ptr = next_desc_ptr`
(advance), and after the **even** field it rewinds `next_desc` to
`start_desc_ptr` with `page_index = line_size + 8`. So its traversal progresses
frame-by-frame and eventually hits STOP. iris needs the same advance.

JUMP handling itself is fine (iris uses `& 0x3fffffff`, matching MAME — the
apparent "skip" of the `0x...0` slot is what MAME does too).

## Next steps

1. Rework `pump_field`/interlace so the descriptor chain advances like MAME's
   `end_of_field` (advance `start_desc_ptr` after the odd field) and the STOP
   descriptor is reached → raises `ISR_CHA_DESC`. **Regression-test 5.3
   capture** (the current rewind logic was tuned for 5.3 — fixes #10/#11 in the
   companion note).
2. Re-verify the descriptor data-address mask: MAME uses `& 0x3ffff000`
   (page-aligned, drops top 2 bits); iris uses `& 0xFFFF_FFF0`. Equivalent for
   clean page-aligned descriptors but worth aligning.

## Repro harness

- `vinograb.c` (VL one-frame grab), `mempeek.c` (`/dev/mem` physical reader) —
  both in repo root, stream to `/var/tmp` and `cc` on the guest.
- Build iris with `--features chd,camera,lightning,developer` and run with
  `IRIS_DEBUG_LOG=vino,mc` to trace register access + MC errors.
- `/tmp` is wiped on boot — put guest test binaries in `/var/tmp`.
- root's shell is now `/bin/sh` on the klindert disk (POSIX redirects work).

## 2026-05-30 — DESC delivery on 6.5 SOLVED at the kernel/DMA layer; blocker moved up to videod

Two findings this session, one a fix and one a self-inflicted regression now reverted:

1. **Uncached-alias fix (KEEP — `src/physical.rs`).** 6.5's vino driver polls the
   descriptor ring through the uncached `0x4000_0000` alias of RAM. The bus
   dispatch didn't map that alias, so reads/writes to the ring missed, flooding
   `MC: CPU Error at 48621cf0` and capture never engaged. Added `alias_phys()`
   (`if addr & 0xC000_0000 == 0x4000_0000 { addr & !0x4000_0000 }`) at the head of
   all 9 BusDevice dispatch methods. With this, capture engages on 6.5.

2. **DESC now fires on 6.5 with the KNOWN-GOOD (HEAD) descriptor code.** Confirmed
   directly: `INTR_STATUS -> 0x00000005` (CHA_EOF|CHA_DESC) fires ~1435× during a
   vidtomem run. So the earlier hypothesis that 6.5 needed an interlace
   restructure (one DESC per frame, no per-row skip, no rewind) was WRONG — that
   restructure REMOVED the descriptor-cursor advance that lands the cursor on the
   chain's STOP, so DESC stopped firing. Reverted `src/vino.rs` to HEAD. The
   original per-row interleave skip + stride pad is load-bearing: one field emits
   ~150 page-writes but the chain is 300 aligned pages, so each write must advance
   the cursor ~2 descriptor slots (the skip) to reach STOP and raise DESC.

3. **6.5 driver descriptor layout (observed live).** videod ping-pongs TWO
   channel-A buffers, re-arming `A_NEXT_4_DESC` alternately to `0x0861e000` and
   `0x0a8cc000`, with `A_FIELD_COUNTER` alternating 1<->2. chainwalk (unaligned
   0x3fffffff mask): `0x0861e000` = 181 data pages -> STOP@086214f0;
   `0x0a8cc000` = 4 data pages -> STOP@0a8cc2d0 (asymmetric — not yet explained;
   16-byte-aligned walk of 0x0861e000 = 300 pages = full 640x480x4 frame).

4. **Remaining blocker is in userspace (videod/VL), NOT the emulator DMA.**
   Despite ~1435 DESC interrupts, stock `vidtomem` never receives a frame. `par -s`
   on the hung vidtomem caught its exit path:
   `select([3])=1; read(3,..,32)=0; "VL connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill
   or server shutdown)"; exit(1)` — i.e. **videod closes the VL connection / dies
   instead of ever delivering a frame**. No vino/video errors in /var/adm/SYSLOG
   and no iris-side errors. So the kernel completes transfers (DESC) but videod's
   frame-done -> VL-buffer-valid path never hands a buffer to the client.

**Next investigation (NOT yet done):** trace `videod` itself (par/par -s on the
1257/1258 pair) across a frame to see which /dev/vino ioctl or register poll it is
waiting on after DESC — i.e. what kernel-visible "buffer N complete" signal videod
expects that iris isn't setting (candidate: FIELD_COUNTER pairing, DESC_TABLE_PTR
readback, or a per-buffer done status videod polls). videod is proprietary, so
this is syscall/ioctl-trace driven.

## 2026-05-30 (cont.) — videod dig: full kernel delivery-path map; root cause localized

Goal of this pass: find why videod never delivers a frame to clients on 6.5 even
though iris now fires DESC+EOF interrupts (see previous section). Combined a LIVE
`par` trace of videod with a full disassembly of the 6.5 kernel driver (vino.o).

### Live videod trace (par -s -i -SS, videod launched under par)
videod opens `/dev/vino` (fd 7), does its analog/camera setup ioctls
(`0x7669000b` blocks ~3 s = video-lock wait, then a burst of `0x76690008`), then
settles into its VL server main loop: `select(1024, [5:6:7:10...], 0,0,0)`. The
ready set returned is ALWAYS client sockets (`[6/10:225:230:231:234...]`) —
**fd 7 (`/dev/vino`) is never in the ready set.** So `/dev/vino` never becomes
poll-readable, videod never collects a captured frame, and the client
(vidtomem / vlGetNextValid) blocks forever. The iris VINO register log shows
continuous autonomous activity (≈5500 capture cycles) DURING videod's idle
select loop — i.e. the kernel ISR (`vinoInterrupt`) IS running on every
EOF/DESC; the interrupt path works. So the break is purely "kernel never marks
/dev/vino poll-ready."

### Kernel poll-readiness mechanism (from vino.o disassembly)
- `vinoPoll` (0x6e1c) reports fd readable IFF `*(dev+0xb8) != 0` (pending-events
  word). Only handles poll bits in `0x41`.
- `*(dev+0xb8)` (pending) is set ONLY inside the static `pollwakeup_fn` (0x6ec8),
  and only when `*(dev+0xb4) & mask != 0`, where `*(dev+0xb4)` is the
  select/poll mask videod sets explicitly via the `vinoSetPollSel` ioctl
  (copyin → `sw a3,0xb4(dev)`). pollwakeup_fn then OR-s mask into `*(dev+0xb8)`
  and calls kernel `pollwakeup()` to wake the select.
- `vinoInterrupt` calls pollwakeup_fn on the **EOF** bit (mask 5 for ch A / 0xa
  for ch B). The **DESC** bit instead calls `vinoEOD` (advances the descriptor
  ring; does NOT itself wake). Full frame delivery to userspace rides on the
  **buffer-completion** path: `vinoEOD`→`vinoGetNextBuffer`→`vinoFinishDMA`
  (which calls kernel `wakeup`) and the state-machine static `0x777c`→wrapper
  `0x6fcc`→pollwakeup_fn — with a different mask than the per-field EOF=5.

### Root cause (localized, not yet fixed)
The interlace **buffer/field completion state machine** never declares a frame
complete, so the delivery pollwakeup (the one whose mask matches videod's
`vinoSetPollSel` registration) never fires, so `*(dev+0xb8)` for that event stays
0, so `vinoPoll` never reports fd 7 ready. The state machine spans:
`vinoInterrupt`→per-channel dispatch `0x5e7c`→predicate `0x7530` (scans buffer
descriptor tables for the `0x80020202` STOP/done sentinel; returns 2 ⇒
"frame ready" which makes the dispatcher signal poll) + sub-handlers
`0x7640/0x77c0/0x78d8` + `vinoEOD` (sets channel state bytes 0x132/0x133/0x134=2/
0x135) + `vinoGetNextBuffer` + `vinoFinishDMA`. It is driven by EOF/DESC order,
the per-channel state bytes, and `A_FIELD_COUNTER`.

### Two concrete, testable iris-side suspects (highest confidence first)
1. **Simultaneous EOF+DESC.** iris raises EOF and DESC in the SAME field pump
   (INTR_STATUS jumps 0x00→0x05). Real VINO fires EOF at end of active video and
   DESC later when the chain's STOP is consumed — two distinct ISR entries. The
   state machine is written for sequential EOF-then-DESC; a combined 0x05 likely
   desyncs the field/buffer bytes so completion never latches. Fix idea: emit EOF
   when the field's active rows finish, then raise DESC as a separate interrupt
   when the descriptor cursor reaches STOP.
2. **field_counter reset per DMA-enable.** `start_channel` (vino.rs:463) zeroes
   `field_counter` on every DMA-enable; the 6.5 driver re-arms DMA per field, so
   the counter reads 1 at most DESCs and can't express the even/odd pairing the
   state machine needs. Fix idea: make A_FIELD_COUNTER free-running across re-arms
   (don't reset in start_channel), reflecting true field parity.

Each test = full rebuild + boot + capture (~6 min), so validate the EOF/DESC
sequencing hypothesis first (strongest). Status: kernel delivery path fully
mapped; exact completion condition in the state machine not yet pinned.

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 2) — completion gate fixed register-by-register; final blocker = buffer ping-pong vs interleave rewind

Drove the kernel completion check (vino.o vinoEOD→0x77c0) from the iris side.
0x77c0 declares a buffer done (returns 2 ⇒ poll-wake videod) iff the live
**A_DESC_TABLE_PTR** read-back has moved off the buffer base — specifically
`s1 != buffer_base && s1 != buffer_base+0x10 && s1 != *(conn+0xc)`, where `s1`
is the channel's A_DESC_TABLE_PTR (reg 0x70, low word read at 0x74).

Fixes applied this pass (all in src/vino.rs, on top of the physical.rs alias):
1. **field_counter free-running** (don't zero in start_channel). More
   hardware-faithful; did NOT by itself fix delivery.
2. **A_DESC_TABLE_PTR read returns the live cursor** (`next_desc_ptr`), not the
   driver-written base (`start_desc_ptr`, still stored on write for the rewind).
   The driver writes the buffer base each field and expects the HARDWARE to
   advance the pointer; reading back the static base made 0x77c0 always see
   "still on base" (returned 1). After this it read base+0x10 — still "just
   started" (0x77c0 also treats base+0x10 as not-done).
3. **next_desc_ptr advances across JUMPs** (shift_descriptors JUMP branch now
   does `next_desc_ptr = target+16`). The 6.5 jump-bug chain is ~all JUMPs, so
   without this the cursor stayed frozen at the re-armed base+0x10. After this
   A_DESC_TABLE_PTR reads an advanced **0x0861e794** (real progress).

Result: register now advances, but **still no frame delivered**, because the
read is CONSTANT at 0x0861e794 every cycle. Root of that: the 6.5 driver
**ping-pongs two ring buffers** — A_NEXT_4_DESC alternates 0x0861e000 (buf A) and
0x141b0000 (buf B) per field — but iris's **interleave rewind** (pump_field,
`if interleave && start_desc_ptr != 0 { descriptor_fetch(start_desc_ptr); ... }`)
resets every field's DMA cursor to start_desc_ptr (= the A_DESC_TABLE_PTR the
driver writes, always 0x0861e000 = buf A). So iris fills buf A every field and
NEVER buf B; A_DESC_TABLE_PTR can only ever report a buf-A address, the driver
never sees the pointer reach the buffer it's waiting on, and 0x77c0 never returns
2.

### Precise remaining blocker + next step
iris must fill the buffer the driver re-armed via **A_NEXT_4_DESC**, not always
rewind to start_desc_ptr. The interleave rewind (iris's single-table even/odd
model) conflicts with the driver's per-field NEXT_4_DESC ping-pong. Next step:
make pump_field honor the live re-arm — walk from the re-armed next_desc_ptr
(track the last NEXT_4_DESC base separately from start_desc_ptr) and apply the
even/odd offset within THAT buffer, instead of unconditionally rewinding to
start_desc_ptr. RISK: this touches the interlace path that IRIX 5.3 delivery
depends on (5.3 uses EOF-only, page-stepped NEXT_4_DESC, no DESC completion), so
it must be gated/validated against 5.3. Uncommitted working tree at this point:
physical.rs (alias) + vino.rs (the 3 changes above). 4 build/test cycles done.

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 3) — FUNDAMENTAL MODELING GAP found; stopping after 6 builds

Continued the register-modeling fixes (rewind-to-rearm-base so iris fills the
buffer the driver actually arms; tried 16-byte JUMP alignment). Both confirmed
fd 7 (/dev/vino) STILL never enters videod's select ready-set — no delivery.

The decisive observation: A_DESC_TABLE_PTR (= live next_desc_ptr) freezes at
~descriptor 120 (0x0861e780), while the driver's descriptor chain runs to its
real STOP at ~descriptor 300 (0x086214f0). With unaligned JUMP following iris
hit a FALSE early STOP there (raised a bogus DESC=0x05); with 16-byte-aligned
following it hits NO stop and raises only EOF=0x01. Either way the cursor stops
at ~120 and never reaches the chain's true end.

ROOT MODELING GAP (the real reason 6.5 capture doesn't deliver):
**iris's DMA is pixel-driven, not descriptor-chain-driven.** `render_and_pump`
emits exactly the clipped pixel rectangle (~one field = ~120-150 pages) and then
STOPS, leaving the descriptor cursor partway through the chain. Real VINO walks
the ENTIRE descriptor chain — writing captured data into every page — until it
consumes the STOP descriptor; for an interlaced 640x480 frame that's ~300 pages,
and the cursor naturally lands on STOP, which is exactly what the driver's
vinoEOD completion check (vino.o 0x77c0) keys on (A_DESC_TABLE_PTR having reached
past the buffer / the chain end). Because iris stops at the pixel count instead
of walking to STOP, the completion pointer is always short and the frame is never
declared done → videod never woken.

Fixing this properly = restructuring the VINO DMA loop to be descriptor-chain-
driven (iterate descriptors to STOP, place each field's data at the interleaved
pages, raise DESC when the STOP descriptor is consumed) rather than pixel-driven.
That is a significant rewrite of render_and_pump/pump_field/dma_emit_dword and
touches the IRIX-5.3 interlace path that currently DELIVERS, so it carries real
regression risk and needs a 5.3-gated, carefully-tested implementation. This is
genuine multi-session work, not a one-line fix.

### State of the working tree at stop
- src/physical.rs: uncached-alias fix — SOLID standalone win (makes 6.5 capture
  engage + DESC fire; no 5.3 regression expected as it's a pure bus-alias fix).
  RECOMMEND COMMITTING THIS ALONE.
- src/vino.rs: register-modeling improvements (field_counter free-run;
  A_DESC_TABLE_PTR read = live next_desc_ptr; next_desc_ptr advances across JUMPs;
  interleave rewind targets the re-armed A_NEXT_4_DESC base). All more
  hardware-faithful and necessary for the eventual fix, but they do NOT by
  themselves deliver a frame and they touch the 5.3 interlace path (UNTESTED on
  5.3). Keep as documented WIP or revert before committing physical.rs.
- jump-align (0x3FFF_FFF0) was tried and REVERTED (it removed DESC entirely).

Net result of the whole campaign: 6.5 IndyCam capture now ENGAGES and the kernel
DMA/interrupt path works (alias fix); the remaining blocker is the pixel-driven
-vs-descriptor-chain-driven DMA model, precisely localized and documented above.

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 4) — descriptor-DMA model now CORRECT (DESC+STOP); delivery still gated on kernel software state

Got the live descriptor chain via a guest-side chaindump (/usr/tmp/chaindump,
reads /dev/mem). Definitive structure of the 6.5 capture chain at 0x0861e000:
**300 linear DATA pages** (sequential frame-buffer pages, NOT interlace-encoded)
**+ 120 jump-bug JUMPs** (one at the end of most 4-descriptor groups, encoded
target carries a +4 low-bit offset), ending with a final **JUMP -> STOP at
0x086214f0** (word 0x80000001). So interlace placement is entirely iris's
line_size-skip job; the chain is a plain linear 640x480 buffer.

Two grounded fixes from this:
1. **16-byte JUMP alignment** (`& 0x3FFF_FFF0`) — required; the intermediate
   jump-bug JUMPs carry +4 offsets and must be followed aligned or the walk
   desyncs.
2. **drain_to_stop** at end of pump_field — after the pixel pump fills the DATA
   pages it stops one descriptor short of the trailing JUMP->STOP; iris now
   walks the remaining descriptors (follow JUMPs / advance past DATA) to consume
   the STOP and raise DESC, as real VINO does.

RESULT: INTR shows 0x05 (DESC fires) AND A_DESC_TABLE_PTR now reads **0x08621500**
— i.e. past the real STOP (0x086214f0 + 0x10). The descriptor-DMA/interrupt model
is now correct end to end at the hardware level.

BUT videod STILL never delivers: a fresh par trace shows fd 7 (/dev/vino) never
enters videod's select ready-set, even with DESC firing and the cursor past STOP.
So the remaining gate is NOT in the VINO register/DMA model — it is in kernel
driver SOFTWARE state that the register interface can't reach:
 - the completion check vino.o 0x77c0 also compares the live ptr against
   *(conn+0xc) (the driver's tracked pointer) and keys on the buffer index
   *(conn+0x104) / count *(conn+0x10c) and the per-channel state byte 0x133;
 - the frame-ready pollwakeup uses the mask videod registered via the
   vinoSetPollSel ioctl (*(dev+0xb4)); the per-field EOF pollwakeup uses mask 5
   and may simply not match videod's registered mask;
 - delivery may require vinoFinishDMA (kernel wakeup + pollwakeup wrapper 0x6fcc)
   to run, which depends on the buffer-queue state machine, not just DESC.

NEXT TECHNIQUE (different from register tracing): inspect the live kernel conn/dev
structs from the guest (/dev/kmem or a small driver-aware probe) to read
*(conn+0xc), *(conn+0x104/0x10c), byte 0x133, and *(dev+0xb4) during a capture,
to see exactly which comparison/state blocks the wakeup. That's a kmem-inspection
task, not a register-model task.

STATE: physical.rs alias (solid) + vino.rs descriptor-DMA model fixes
(field_counter free-run, A_DESC_TABLE_PTR live cursor, 16-byte jump alignment,
per-field rearm rewind, drain-to-STOP). All hardware-faithful and bring the model
to correct DESC+STOP behaviour; UNTESTED on 5.3. 8 build/test cycles this session.

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 5) — KMEM INSPECTION: exact delivery gate found (and my recent changes are counterproductive)

Used icrash on the live guest (it resolves the loaded vino module's symbols).
Anchors: nm vino_going -> 0xc00f0cfc (.data+0x45c, so .data base 0xc00f08a0);
vino_board (.bss+0, 0xc00f1950) holds the device-struct pointer.

Live struct values during a hanging vidtomem grab:
- device = 0x8d2fa9c0 ("vino" magic at +0, reg base 0xa0080000 at +0x20).
- channel-A conn = *(dev+0x38) = 0x93c98780.
- conn fields: +0x04=0x941f4300 (buffer-entry array), +0x0c=**0x0861e000** (buffer
  base = the value the completion check compares against), +0x14=0x8d2fa9c0 (= the
  device struct; this is the poll "dev"), +0x104=0 (buffer index), +0x10c=5 (buffer
  count), byte 0x133=0x01, byte 0x136=0x1e(30), bytes 0x134/0x135=0.
- **poll state on dev: *(dev+0xb0)=0x20 (poll armed), *(dev+0xb4)=0x140 (videod's
  selected event mask), *(dev+0xb8)=0 (pending=0 -> vinoPoll reports NOT ready).**

### The delivery logic (vino.o), decoded against these values
- vinoInterrupt's per-channel dispatch (static 0x5e7c): when byte 0x133!=0 it calls
  the completion check 0x77c0; **if 0x77c0 returns 2 the dispatcher RETURNS EARLY
  and SKIPS the delivery function 0x7640.** 0x77c0 returns 2 when the live
  A_DESC_TABLE_PTR is NOT equal to the buffer base / *(conn+0xc); returns 0/1 when
  it IS at the buffer base. So delivery requires A_DESC_TABLE_PTR == buffer base
  (0x0861e000) at the DESC interrupt.
- **=> My A_DESC_TABLE_PTR live-cursor + drain-to-STOP changes are COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
  for delivery: they make the read 0x08621500 (past STOP) -> 0x77c0 returns 2 ->
  0x7640 is skipped. The original behaviour (A_DESC_TABLE_PTR == base) is what lets
  0x77c0 return 0/1 and reach 0x7640.** (The drain still correctly raises DESC; the
  pointer value is the problem.)
- The actual frame-ready pollwakeup is in 0x7640 at 0x7770: wrapper 0x6fcc with
  mask 0x30. It is reached only when (field_counter - *(conn+0xc0)) > *(conn+0x136)
  (=30) and other field-pairing conditions on *(conn+0x118)&3, byte 0xb8, etc.

### UNRESOLVED puzzle (the real blocker now)
The poll masks don't line up: videod's selected mask *(dev+0xb4)=0x140 (bits 6,8),
but every internal wakeup mask found is disjoint from it — EOF=5 (bits 0,2),
0x7640-delivery=0x30 (bits 4,5), ioctl-path=0x1000/0x2000/0x4000. 0x140 & {5,0x30,
0x1000...} = 0 for all. pollwakeup_fn gates on *(dev+0xb4) & internal_mask, so with
0x140 NOTHING wakes videod. Either *(dev+0xb4)=0x140 is not the field I think it is
(vino_poll/vinoPoll route the poll head via a .bss+0x20 global, not directly via
conn+0x14), or videod re-arms the mask per grab and I sampled a stale value, or the
mask bit-space differs. Resolving this needs: re-read *(dev+0xb4) at the exact
moment vidtomem issues its grab ioctl (correlate with a par trace), and trace
vino_poll/vinoPoll's poll-head (.bss+0x20 = 0xc00f1970) which is what select
actually queries.

### Recommended next steps (next session)
1. REVERT the A_DESC_TABLE_PTR live-cursor + drain-to-STOP changes (they block
   0x7640). Keep DESC firing via the original STOP-in-pump path. Keep physical.rs
   alias. Re-evaluate field_counter free-run (the 0x7640 delta logic uses
   field_counter - *(conn+0xc0); free-run is fine for deltas but verify).
2. Pin the poll-mask space: read .bss+0x20 (0xc00f1970) poll-head + re-read
   *(dev+0xb4) synchronized with a grab, to learn which internal mask actually
   matches what videod selects.
3. Then make iris satisfy the 0x7640 field-delta gate so the wrapper(0x30) fires.

icrash recipe (reusable): `icrash -e 'od <hexaddr> <words>'` reads /dev/kmem;
`icrash -e 'nm <sym>'` resolves module symbols; `icrash -f cmdfile` batches.
chaindump/chainwalk live in /usr/tmp in the guest (extract via dd bs=512 from
/dev/rdsk/dks0d2s0 after iris-ci put, then truncate with bs=1 on the regular file).

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 6) — COMPLETE delivery path traced via kmem; precise blocker = *(conn+0xc) never cleared

icrash note: the vino module loads at a DIFFERENT base each boot, so re-derive
addresses every boot: `od vino_board N` -> device ptr; device+0x38 = ch-A conn;
conn+0x14 = device (poll dev). This boot: vino_board@0xc00db950 -> device
0x927c9480 -> conn 0x93278900.

### Delivery is the BLOCKING path, NOT poll
- videod's worker blocks in vinoGetFrame (0x37d0): `sleep(conn, 0x13c)` at 0x3b64,
  woken by `wakeup(conn)`; on wake it calls vinoFinishDMA and returns the frame.
  (*(conn+0x118) is a STATIC config word set once at init (only store to 0x118 is
  in vino_init@0x33a0); its bit3/bit&3 are mode flags, NOT a per-frame ready bit.)
- The POLL path is DEAD: videod's selected mask *(dev+0xb4)=0x140 (live), but every
  pollwakeup mask is disjoint from it — EOF=5, the 0x7640 frame-ready wrapper=0x30,
  ioctl-path=0x1000/0x2000/0x4000. 0x140 & {5,0x30,...}=0, and *(dev+0xb8)=0
  (pending), so vinoPoll never reports fd 7 ready. So delivery cannot come through
  select(fd 7); it must be wakeup(conn).

### The only wakeup(conn) and what gates it
- `wakeup` exists once (vinoFinishDMA@0x751c). vinoFinishDMA is reached in the
  capture path via vinoCheckDMA(flag&0x10)@0x6be4, and vinoCheckDMA is called by
  **vinoWakeupTimeout** (a self-rescheduling timer, 0x5304) and vinoDMRBCallback.
- vinoWakeupTimeout's finish gate: at 0x5324 `lw $v1,0xc($conn); bnez $v1,0x535c`
  — if **`*(conn+0xc) != 0` it just RESCHEDULES** (no finish). Only when
  `*(conn+0xc) == 0` does it switch on byte *(conn+0x135) and reach
  vinoCheckDMA/vinoFinishDMA -> wakeup(conn) -> videod delivered.
- LIVE: `*(conn+0xc) = 0x0861e000` (the buffer base) — never cleared. So the timer
  loops forever and the frame is never delivered.

### Who clears *(conn+0xc)
vinoFinishDMA (0x72e0) and vinoEOD (0x69c8) clear it. vinoEOD's clear path (0x69c8)
is taken only when vinoGetNextBuffer (called at 0x6900) returns < 0 (buffer ring
exhausted: gated on *(conn+0x28), *(conn+0x18), byte *(conn+0x134), and the global
in-progress flag .data+0x438[+0xe4]). So iris's DESC/EOF interrupt sequence is not
driving vinoEOD->vinoGetNextBuffer into the "ring exhausted" state that clears
*(conn+0xc). That is the precise remaining gap.

Live conn (0x93278900) snapshot during a hung grab: +0x04=bufarray 0x972e1780,
+0x0c=0x0861e000(!), +0x14=dev, +0x100=0xa86214f0 (live desc ptr at STOP, KSEG1),
+0x104=0 (buf idx), +0x10c=5 (buf count), +0xc0=1 (last-delivered field), byte
0xb8=1, byte 0x133=1, byte 0x136=0x1e(30), *(conn+0x118)=0x0027 (&3==3, &8==0).

### Next step (next session): make iris drive the buffer ring to completion
Trace vinoEOD + vinoGetNextBuffer against the live buffer-ring fields across the
DESC sequence to find which register/state iris must present so vinoGetNextBuffer
returns <0 (or vinoEOD otherwise clears *(conn+0xc)). This is a software
state-machine match driven by the count/order of DESC interrupts vs the 5-deep
buffer ring — NOT a single register value. field_counter free-run alone is
insufficient (tested: build #1 failed) because the gate is *(conn+0xc), not the
0x7640 field-delta.

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 7) — CORRECTION: poll path IS viable (mask 0xc0); delivery gate = field-parity counter *(conn+0xd2)

Earlier "poll path is dead" was WRONG — I had not found all the pollwakeup masks.
The REAL frame delivery is the EOF-path static **0x60b4** (called by vinoInterrupt
on EOF, with conn): it runs vinoFillInfo + dms_block_end_dma + dms_fifo_enq to
finalize the captured buffer, then calls the pollwakeup wrapper 0x6fcc with
**mask 0xc0** (at 0x6268). videod's selected mask *(dev+0xb4)=0x140, and
0xc0 & 0x140 = 0x40 → **MATCH**. So EOF -> 0x60b4 -> pollwakeup(0xc0) wakes videod's
select(fd 7). (The 0x30 wrapper in 0x7640 and EOF mask 5 are red herrings.)

### The exact gate that blocks 0x60b4's delivery
Walking 0x60b4 with live conn values (*(conn+0x118)=0x27): it reaches the delivery
tail only past **0x61cc: `lw v1,0xd0(conn); andi v1,1; beql v1,zero,return`** —
i.e. delivery requires the WORD at conn+0xd0 to be ODD (interlace even/odd pairing).
LIVE: word@0xd0 = 0x00000002 (EVEN) -> returns, no delivery.

word@0xd0 = (halfword 0xd0 << 16) | halfword 0xd2. 0x7640 increments only the HIGH
half (sh@0x76c0), so the word's bit0 = bit0 of ***(conn+0xd2)**, written at 0x76c8:
`*(conn+0xd2) = t2 = (A_FIELD_COUNTER + t1)`. So **delivery parity is driven by
iris's A_FIELD_COUNTER value** (t1 derives from *(conn+0x118)&3 and field parity).
LIVE *(conn+0xd2)=2 (even) and appears stuck even -> never delivers.

So the whole chain reduces to: **iris must present A_FIELD_COUNTER such that the
driver's 0x7640 sets *(conn+0xd2) ODD on the field whose EOF runs 0x60b4.** This is
the interlace field-pairing, and HEAD's field_counter (resets to 0 per DMA-enable)
isn't producing it. (Free-running field_counter alone — build #1 — also failed, so
the exact A_FIELD_COUNTER sequence/parity the driver expects per re-arm needs to be
matched, not just "made large". The 0x7640 counter arithmetic vs the live
field_counter values still needs untangling.)

Live conn this run (0x93278d80): +0xc=0x0861e000, +0xc0=1, word@0xd0=0x00000002
(=> *(conn+0xd0)=0, *(conn+0xd2)=2), +0x118=0x0027, +0x10c=5, +0x104=0.
icrash addresses change per boot (module reloc): vino_board@0xc00db950 ->
device 0x927c9480 -> conn *(device+0x38).

### Refined next step
Correlate the live A_FIELD_COUNTER register reads (iris log) with *(conn+0xd2)
across the DESC/EOF sequence to learn the exact parity the driver expects, then
adjust how iris reports CH_FIELD_COUNTER (and possibly when it raises EOF vs DESC)
so *(conn+0xd2) lands ODD on a delivering field. This is now a bounded
field-counter/parity problem on a KNOWN-viable poll delivery path — a much better
position than "poll is impossible".

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 8) — free-running field_counter fixes the parity COUNTER but not delivery; suspect EOF+DESC simultaneity

Applied free-running field_counter (removed the reset in start_channel). Confirmed:
A_FIELD_COUNTER now VARIES (0x676,0x677,...) instead of being stuck at 1, and the
driver's parity word now counts: live word@conn+0xd0 went 0x000029fe -> 0x00002a00
(*(conn+0xd2) incrementing ~1/field, so it DOES pass through odd values e.g.
0x29ff). So the delivery parity gate (0x60b4 @ 0x61cc requires word@0xd0 ODD) is now
SATISFIABLE — but still NO frame delivered (no /usr/tmp/cap-00000.rgb; INTR still
0x05; vino.rs otherwise HEAD; conn this run 0x920c2c00, *(conn+0x118)=0x0027).

So field_counter was necessary (parity was structurally stuck before) but not
sufficient. The remaining suspicion: the EOF handler 0x60b4 reads *(conn+0xd2) at a
moment it is consistently EVEN, because iris raises EOF and DESC TOGETHER as a
single INTR=0x05. In vinoInterrupt the EOF bit (-> 0x60b4, which READS the parity)
and the DESC/dispatch path (-> 0x7640, which WRITES the parity) are processed in the
same ISR pass, so 0x60b4 likely always sees the just-written (even) value and the
odd half-cycle is never observed at an EOF. Real VINO raises EOF (end of active
video) and DESC (descriptor STOP) as SEPARATE, temporally-ordered interrupts.

### Strong next hypothesis (was old hypothesis #2, now well-motivated)
Make iris raise EOF and DESC as DISTINCT interrupt events with the driver's ISR
running between them (e.g. raise EOF at end of the field's active-video pump, wait
for the driver to ack/clear it, THEN raise DESC when the descriptor cursor consumes
STOP) — so 0x60b4's *(conn+0xd2) read lands on the ODD half-cycle. Keep the
free-running field_counter (it is hardware-correct and a prerequisite). This is the
last identified gate on a KNOWN-viable poll-delivery path (pollwakeup mask 0xc0
matches videod's 0x140). Working tree currently: physical.rs(committed alias) +
vino.rs(free-running field_counter, uncommitted, correct-but-insufficient).

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 9) — EOF/DESC split WORKS mechanically + parity reaches odd, but STILL no delivery

Implemented the EOF/DESC separation (defer DESC: dma_emit_dword records
stop_reached instead of raising DESC; pump_field raises EOF, polls until the
driver clears the EOF bit, then raises DESC) + kept free-running field_counter.
Build verified: INTR now shows **0x01 (EOF alone) and 0x04 (DESC alone) as
SEPARATE events** (1768x / 1485x), no longer the combined 0x05. And the driver's
parity word @conn+0xd0 now passes through ODD (live reads 0x2ae3 odd, 0x2aec,
0x2af0). So the field-parity gate (0x60b4 @ 0x61cc) is now genuinely satisfiable.
**Yet still NO frame delivered** (no /usr/tmp/cap-00000.rgb).

So neither the EOF+DESC simultaneity NOR the field-parity counter was the final
blocker — both are now correct and delivery still fails. Also note: 0x7640 (the
parity WRITER) is gated by intr&9 = bits {0,3} = EOF, and 0x60b4 (the READER) is
also the EOF handler — so both already happen on the SAME EOF interrupt regardless
of the split; splitting EOF/DESC therefore can't change their relative order. The
split was a dead end for this gate (though it's more hardware-faithful).

Remaining suspects (past 0x61cc, in 0x60b4's delivery tail, all UNVERIFIED):
- 0x60b4 may not actually REACH 0x61cc on an odd-parity EOF (an earlier branch:
  *(conn+0x118)&0x20 routing at 0x6174, the vinoGetNextBuffer call at 0x61a0, or
  the byte 0x13a/0x13b compare at 0x614c). Verify by reading *(conn+0xc4) (the
  delivery path does `*(conn+0xc4)+=2` at 0x61e0) — if it never increments, 0x60b4
  never reaches delivery even when parity is odd.
- The finalize calls vinoFillInfo / dms_block_end_dma / dms_fifo_enq may fail on
  the captured buffer (bad metadata), or the pollwakeup(0xc0) fires but videod's
  vinoPoll still reports not-ready (check *(dev+0xb8) becomes nonzero at delivery).
NOTE: par tracing now needs rtmond, which I disabled for boot speed — re-enable
(`chkconfig rtmond on`) before using par.

Working tree: physical.rs(committed alias) + vino.rs(free-running field_counter +
EOF/DESC split, uncommitted, mechanically-correct-but-still-no-delivery, untested
on 5.3). Build ~12. Stopping here per plan — no new concrete lead without more
kmem cycles on whether 0x60b4 reaches its delivery tail.

### DECISIVE: 0x60b4 never reaches its delivery tail (*(conn+0xc4) stuck at 0)
Read *(conn+0xc4) twice ~13s apart during an active capture: BOTH 0x00000000. The
0x60b4 delivery path does `*(conn+0xc4) += 2` (0x61e0), so 0x60b4 is RETURNING
before 0x61e0 on every EOF — i.e. the parity check at 0x61cc sees EVEN at the
EOF-ISR moment every time, even though *(conn+0xd2) (only written by 0x7640) is
observed ODD at random kmem-read times. So the WRITE (0x7640, parity) and the READ
(0x60b4, same EOF ISR) are not aligning to an odd value at the read, contradicting
the naive "0x7640 in the dispatch loop runs before 0x60b4 in the bit-handler".
Resolve next time by single-stepping the value 0x7640 writes vs what 0x60b4 reads
on ONE EOF (e.g. instrument iris to log A_FIELD_COUNTER at the exact EOF raise, and
read *(conn+0xd2) right after) — the +t1 term / which field's counter the driver
samples is the missing piece. The free-running field_counter and EOF/DESC split are
mechanically correct (verified: INTR 0x01/0x04 separate; parity word alternates)
but neither opens delivery, so they were REVERTED to keep the committed state clean
(physical.rs alias only). Re-enable rtmond before par. Build ~12; stopping.

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 10) — INSTRUMENTATION: field_counter parity is FINE; the parity line is ruled out

Added a FCREAD log (every CH_FIELD_COUNTER read -> val, parity, int_status) with
free-running field_counter. Result: channel-A A_FIELD_COUNTER reads increment
cleanly 0x1,0x2,0x3,0x4,... with ALTERNATING parity (the parity=0 skew is just
channel-B reads which are always 0x0). So iris presents alternating parity, NOT a
pinned value. => **The field_counter parity is NOT the delivery blocker.** The
whole field-parity line (free-running field_counter, EOF/DESC split) was chasing a
non-issue and is abandoned.

Reconciles the earlier contradiction: my 0x7640 read "*(conn+0xd2) =
A_FIELD_COUNTER + (field_counter&1)" must be WRONG — kmem showed *(conn+0xd2)~10979
(odd) while A_FIELD_COUNTER~1663, so *(conn+0xd2) is a different/larger counter, not
field_counter+small. The 0x60b4 0x61cc parity check is therefore NOT the thing
field_counter controls.

### Real remaining lead (new direction): the capture-mode config *(conn+0x118)
Delivery in 0x60b4 reaches its tail only if byte 0x133 == 0 (0x61ac) OR
*(conn+0x118)&1 == 0 (0x61c0 skips the parity check) OR the 0x61cc parity is odd.
Live: byte 0x133 = 1 and *(conn+0x118) = 0x27 (bit0 set), so it is forced through
the 0x61cc parity check — and *(conn+0xc4) stays 0, proving it never passes. So the
question is why iris's capture setup makes the driver configure *(conn+0x118)=0x27 /
byte 0x133=1 (the interlace/field mode), vs a mode where bit0 is clear (direct
delivery). *(conn+0x118) is written once (0x33a0); trace what value it stores and
what capture-mode input (VL request / register) it depends on. Also worth checking:
whether the *(conn+0xd0)/0xd2 counters are MSC/UST (frame stream counts) rather than
field parity, which would mean 0x61cc gates on stream progress not field parity.

Instrumentation reverted; committed state remains physical.rs alias only (8426efd).

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 11) — RESOLVED to a single bit: delivery needs *(conn+0x118)&1 == 0 (a capture-mode config bit)

Settled the parity contradiction: sampled *(conn+0xd0) word 3x during capture —
0x2a36, 0x2d88, 0x30aa, ALL EVEN. So *(conn+0xd2) (= field_counter+(field_counter&1)
per 0x7640, the ONLY writer) really is ALWAYS EVEN; the earlier "0x2ae3 odd" was a
torn read. => the 0x60b4 @ 0x61cc parity check is STRUCTURALLY always-failing (even
on real hw).

Full 0x60b4 delivery condition to reach the finalize tail (0x61e0: *(conn+0xc4)+=2,
vinoFillInfo, dms_block_end_dma, dms_fifo_enq, pollwakeup wrapper mask 0xc0):
  (0x61cc parity ODD  OR  0x61c0: *(conn+0x118)&1 == 0)   AND   0x61dc: byte 0x133 != 0
Parity is always even, so the only route is **\*(conn+0x118)&1 == 0** (and byte
0x133 != 0, which is satisfied =1). LIVE iris: *(conn+0x118)=0x27 (bit0 SET) -> the
sole delivery route is closed -> *(conn+0xc4) stays 0 -> never delivers. CONFIRMED.

Both gate fields are CAPTURE-MODE config copied in vinoSetupGetFrame (0x30a8):
  - *(conn+0x118) = *(s1+0x3a)          (writer 0x33a0)
  - byte 0x133    = (src & 4) != 0      (writer 0x3414-0x3420; bit2 of a config word)
s1 is the capture request/params (vinoSetupGetFrame's working struct, kern_malloc
0x6c + filled from the VL request / camera defaults). So the driver is in a capture
MODE (interlace/field flags) whose *(conn+0x118) bit0 is set, which routes 0x60b4
through the dead parity path.

### THE remaining question (single, precise, fresh direction)
Why does iris's capture produce *(conn+0x118) bit0 = 1? It comes from *(s1+0x3a)
bit0 in vinoSetupGetFrame's request struct, which encodes the capture format/mode
videod negotiated. Either (a) videod requests a mode (interlaced 2-field) that on
real hw ALSO sets bit0 but real hw delivers via a DIFFERENT path than 0x60b4 (i.e.
0x60b4 may NOT be the delivery fn for this mode — re-check vinoFillInfo/dms_fifo_enq
callers; only 0x60b4 was assumed), OR (b) iris presents a video format/capability
that makes videod pick the wrong mode and a correct format would clear bit0. Trace
vinoSetupGetFrame's s1 population (what fills +0x3a) and which VL/format input it
maps to. This is a capture-mode-negotiation question, NOT field_counter/parity (both
now definitively excluded).

Committed state remains physical.rs alias only (8426efd). Session reached the floor
of the delivery chain: a single capture-mode config bit. Next session starts here.

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 12) — FULL delivery path re-derived; cont. 7–11 was a dead path; iris root cause + fix found

Re-disassembled the ENTIRE 6.5 kernel delivery path from vino.o (capstone, symbol +
reloc aware; `/tmp/dv2.py`, `/tmp/vino.o`). This SUPERSEDES the cont. 7–11 "single
bit `*(conn+0x118)&1`" conclusion — that path is structurally dead and was never how
real HW delivers. Findings, each grounded in the disassembly:

### 1. `0x118` and `byte0x133` come from videod, not iris (so chasing them is futile)
`vinoSetupGetFrame` (0x30a8) `kern_malloc`s a 0x6c struct `s1` and `copyin`s it from
userspace (0x3134) — it is videod's VL request. Then:
  - 0x339c/0x33a0: `*(conn+0x118) = halfword *(s1+0x3a)`
  - 0x3414/0x3420: `byte *(conn+0x133) = (*(s1+0x38) & 4) != 0`
iris cannot influence these; real HW gets the SAME values (`0x118=0x27`, `0x133=1`).
So the cont. 11 "trace what makes videod clear bit0" direction is a dead end.

### 2. `0x60b4` IS the unique frame finalizer (sanity check passed)
`vinoFillInfo` and `dms_fifo_enq` are each called from exactly ONE site, both inside
`0x60b4`. So `0x60b4` is not a red herring — it is the only enqueue path. Its delivery
tail (0x61e0/0x6308) is reached iff `byte0x133==0 OR 0x118&1==0 OR word@0xd0 parity
ODD`. Live (`0x118=0x27`,`0x133=1`) ⇒ needs parity ODD.

### 3. Parity is gated by `conn+0xb8`, NOT by field_counter's own parity
Decoded the parity writer `0x7640` (called from the per-channel dispatcher `0x5e7c`
on EOF, with `a1 = A_FIELD_COUNTER` = VINO reg 0x4c = iris `chan.field_counter`). In
mode `0x118&3==3`:
  - `conn+0xb8 != 0`: `*(conn+0xd2) = a1 + (a1&1)` → ALWAYS EVEN.
  - `conn+0xb8 == 0` AND `(a1 - conn+0xc0) == 1`: `*(conn+0xd2) = a1 + conn+0xbc`
    (prev field's parity) → `field+1+(prevfield&1)` = ALWAYS ODD (delta==1 ⇒ odd
    regardless of which field is even).
`conn+0xb8` = "first field after DMA (re)start" flag: SET=1 on every arm/restart
(0x5028 in the start-capture fn `0x4e1c`; 0x6ae8 in the buffer-restart fn `0x6a70`);
CLEARED by the first field's `0x7640` (0x769c). So a clean 2-field frame delivers on
**field 2**: field1 EOF clears 0xb8 (parity even), field2 EOF sees 0xb8==0 + delta==1
→ parity ODD → `0x60b4` tail.

### 4. The delivery MECHANISM is `wakeup(conn)`, and `0x60b4`'s tail unblocks it
videod blocks in `vinoGetFrame` `sleep(conn,0x13c)` (0x3b64; `0x118&8==0` ⇒ blocking).
Only `wakeup(conn)` is in `vinoFinishDMA` (0x751c). `vinoFinishDMA` runs from the timer
`vinoWakeupTimeout` ONLY when `*(conn+0xc)==0` (0x5324: `lw v1,0xc(conn); bnez ...
reschedule`). `0x60b4`'s tail clears `*(conn+0xc)` at 0x6360 (when the buffer's current
descriptor is not a JUMP, i.e. STOP/end). So `0x60b4` reaching its tail BOTH enqueues
the frame AND clears `*(conn+0xc)` → next timer tick → `vinoFinishDMA` → `wakeup` →
`vinoGetFrame` returns. cont. 6 (wakeup path) and cont. 11 (0x60b4 gate) are ONE gate.

### 5. `vinoEOD` (DESC) requires EOF in the same ISR pass — so combined 0x05 is RIGHT
`vinoEOD` (0x6890): `beqz a2, 0x6970` (abort) where `a2` = "EOF-A also fired this pass"
(set by vinoInterrupt at 0x5cf0 when bit0 handled, passed to vinoEOD at 0x5d5c). So
DESC alone aborts vinoEOD; the cont. 8/9 EOF/DESC SPLIT made `a2=0` and was harmful.
On the odd field, EOF+DESC together (0x05) is correct. Order within one ISR pass:
dispatcher `0x5e7c`→`0x7640` (writes parity) FIRST, then bit0 handler `0x60b4` (reads
parity), then bit2 handler `vinoEOD` — so `0x60b4` reads the parity `0x7640` just wrote.

### 6. iris ROOT CAUSE
iris hits a STOP descriptor and disables DMA EVERY field (`vino.rs:588`; the per-field
cursor rewind at `vino.rs:707` + per-row interleave skip make the cursor reach the
chain STOP each field). The kernel re-arms DMA each field → `conn+0xb8=1` each field →
`0x7640` always EVEN branch → parity never odd → `0x60b4` tail never reached →
`*(conn+0xc)` never clears → videod never woken. (Matches live: `conn+0xc=0x0861e000`
forever; `*(conn+0xd2)` sampled even.)

### 7. THE FIX (IMPLEMENTED — compiles + unit-tested; live validation pending)
Implemented in `dma_emit_dword` (`src/vino.rs`), NOT via the pump_field rewind. Insight:
a DMA-enable cycle = one interlaced frame; `field_counter` (reset to 0 in
`start_channel`, incremented per field) IS the in-cycle field index. At the STOP
descriptor, `if interleave && field_counter == 0` (first field) → return false WITHOUT
raising DESC or disabling DMA (EOF still fires in pump_field); the second field
(`field_counter>=1`) raises EOF+DESC + disables DMA as before. Result: INTR `0x01` on
field 1, `0x05` on field 2 (was `0x05` every field). Kernel restarts once per frame, so
`conn+0xb8` is cleared by field 1 and 0 at field 2's EOF; delta==1 (kernel reads
post-increment counters 1 then 2, conn+0xc0=1 ⇒ 2-1=1); parity ODD; `0x60b4` delivers +
clears `*(conn+0xc)`; `vinoFinishDMA`→`wakeup` unblocks `vinoGetFrame`. Keyed on
`field_counter==0` rather than source parity so it's robust to even/odd alignment vs the
DMA-enable boundary. Did NOT touch the `pump_field` rewind (`vino.rs:707`) — both fields
still rewind to the buffer base and write their own rows (even rows / odd rows) into the
shared frame buffer; only the DESC interrupt is deferred. **5.3 GATE (structural):** 5.3
is EOF-driven, page-steps NEXT_4_DESC per field, never reaches a STOP descriptor here ⇒
this branch never runs for 5.3; also `interleave`-gated. New unit tests:
`interleave_defers_desc_to_second_field`, `non_interleave_stop_completes_immediately`.
STILL must regression-test 5.3 live. The earlier "even=EOF/odd=EOF+DESC didn't deliver"
attempt (top of doc) is NOT a counter-example: it predates the physical.rs alias fix, so
the kernel ring polling was broken and that test was invalid.

### Decisive cheap verification (live kmem, ~1 boot)
- HEAD build now: read byte `conn+0xb8` during capture → expect 1 (confirms #6).
- After the fix: at the odd field's EOF read `conn+0xb8` (→0), `*(conn+0xd2)` (→odd),
  `*(conn+0xc)` (→reaches 0). Any one of these confirms/refutes the chain.
icrash (module relocates per boot — re-derive each boot): `od vino_board 1`→device;
`od (device+0x38) 1`→ch-A conn; then `od (conn+0xb8) 1`, `od (conn+0xd0) 1`, etc.

### Tooling note
`/tmp/dv2.py` (host) is the symbol/reloc-aware disassembler used this session:
`python3 /tmp/dv2.py <symbol>` | `-r <start> <end>` (raw range) | `-c <symbol>`
(callers via relocs). vino.o at `/tmp/vino.o`. Committed state unchanged: physical.rs
alias only (8426efd); src/vino.rs at HEAD.

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 13) — LIVE TEST of the cont.12 fix: parity now reaches ODD, but delivery still blocked

Built `--release --features chd,camera,lightning,developer`, booted the klindert 6.5
guest (`iris --config iris-klindert.toml --ci --ci-display`; autoboots straight to the
login prompt, no PROM menu), started `/usr/etc/videod` (DISPLAY=:0.0; Xsgi is up via
xdm), ran stock `/usr/sbin/vidtomem -f /var/tmp/cap -v 0`. Added env-gated `VINOTRACE`
eprintln hooks (since removed) to log per-field behavior.

### The fix works mechanically (VINOTRACE, steady repeating cycle)
```
start_channel ch0 fc_reset(was 2)
STOP ch0 fc=0 interleave=true -> skip(defer)
pump ch0 parity=Odd  fc->1 intr=0x01
STOP ch0 fc=1 interleave=true -> DESC+disable
pump ch0 parity=Even fc->2 intr=0x05
(repeat)
```
So exactly the intended pattern: 2 fields per DMA-enable cycle, field 1 (fc=0) defers
its STOP (EOF only, INTR 0x01), field 2 (fc=1) completes (EOF+DESC, INTR 0x05). Was
`0x05` every field before. (Source parity happens to be Odd-then-Even here; the gate is
keyed on fc, not parity, so that's fine.)

### Kernel state advanced — parity now ODD (icrash, live, 6 samples)
Re-derived per boot: `vino_board`→device→`*(device+0x38)`=conn. Sampled `*(conn+0xc)`
and the `0xb8..0xd4` block repeatedly:
- `conn+0xb8` (byte) now CLEARS to 0 after field 1 (was STUCK at 1 every field before
  the fix) — re-set to 1 by the per-frame restart after field 2.
- `*(conn+0xd0)` word ALTERNATES `0x....0002` (even, with `conn+0xc0`=1) and
  **`0x....0003` (ODD, with `conn+0xc0`=2)**. So `*(conn+0xd2)` now reaches ODD on
  field 2 — the cont.11 "structurally always even" gate is SATISFIED. The high half
  (MSC/frame count) increments steadily (0x11ac,0x1320,0x14a4,0x161e,0x179d,0x1923).

### But delivery STILL fails (the real remaining gate)
- `*(conn+0xc4)` = 0 in ALL samples. The `0x60b4` delivery tail does `*(conn+0xc4)+=2`
  (0x61e0), so `0x60b4` is NOT reaching its tail even though parity is odd.
- `*(conn+0xc)` = `0x0861e000` (buffer base), never cleared → `vinoWakeupTimeout` keeps
  rescheduling, `vinoFinishDMA`/`wakeup(conn)` never runs.
- `vidtomem` never produces `cap-00000.rgb` (NO_FRAME); it stays blocked in vinoGetFrame.
So clearing `conn+0xb8` + getting odd parity is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT.

### Where the next gate is (analysis, not yet resolved)
vinoInterrupt calls `0x60b4` (EOF handler / reader of the parity) ONLY when the
per-channel dispatcher `0x5e7c` RETURNS 0 (at 0x5ad4: `beqz (s1|s2), 0x5cb8`, where
s1/s2 are the dispatcher returns; 0x5cb8 is the `0x60b4` block). The dispatcher returns
NONZERO (→ `0x60b4` skipped, loop re-reads INTR) when:
- `0x77c0` (completion check) returns 2 (→ 0x5f80, return 1), OR
- `0x7640` (parity writer) returns 1 — its abort path at 0x7794 (`xor at,a0,v0; andi 1;
  beqz 0x7794` → vinoAbortDMA, v0=1). `0x7640`'s return depends on `0x77c0`'s return
  (passed in as a2/v0) and the parity.
Crucially `0x7640` writes `*(conn+0xd2)` at 0x76c8 BEFORE computing its return value, so
the odd parity we observe can be written while `0x60b4` is still skipped that ISR.
Also note the loop earlier calls `0x7530` (scan buffers for the `0x80020202` done
sentinel) and, if it returns nonzero, calls `0x75a4` (a restart/abort) and SKIPS the
dispatcher+`0x60b4` for that channel entirely.

So the next investigation is the **completion state machine** `0x7530`/`0x77c0`/`0x7640`
(+ `0x75a4`, vinoEOD) and the dispatcher `0x5e7c` return path — specifically why, on the
odd field, the dispatcher returns nonzero (or `0x7530` fires the restart) so `0x60b4`'s
delivery is bypassed. Needs the dispatcher arg mapping pinned (a1=reg0x74
A_DESC_TABLE_PTR vs a3=reg0x4c field_counter; iris returns `CH_DESC_TABLE_PTR` =
`start_desc_ptr` = buffer base, `CH_FIELD_COUNTER` = `field_counter`) and live values of
`0x77c0`'s inputs (`*(conn+0x104)` buf idx, `*(conn+4)` buf array, `*(conn+0xc)`) on the
delivering field. icrash + a kernel-side correlation (or more VINOTRACE on the iris reg
reads the kernel makes during the odd-field ISR).

### Mechanics / harness notes (this session)
- Launch: `iris --config iris-klindert.toml --ci --ci-display` (REX3 on for Xsgi/videod;
  XQuartz present). Autoboots → `iris-ci start` then `serial-wait 'IRIS console login:'`
  (~90s), `iris-ci login`. `iris-ci boot` times out waiting for "Option?" because the
  PROM autoboots — use `start` + `serial-wait login` instead.
- videod isn't auto-running on klindert; start it: `DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/etc/videod &`.
  `vlinfo` then shows `vino 0` + Memory Drain nodes. Run `vidtomem` with `DISPLAY=:0.0`.
- icrash through `iris-ci run` truncates on pipes and prints a spurious
  `guest exit -1`; redirect icrash to a file (`>/var/tmp/x 2>&1`) and `cat` it back. A
  6×-icrash loop exceeds the 60s `run` wait — keep batches small or bump the timeout.
- Halt cleanly (`sync;sync; halt -y`, wait for "THE SYSTEM IS BEING SHUT DOWN", ~30s)
  before `iris-ci quit` to avoid XFS damage. Did so this session.
- Fix kept (uncommitted), VINOTRACE instrumentation removed; 10 vino unit tests pass.

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 14) — EXACT abort gate pinpointed; DESC_TABLE_PTR=base+0x10 fix tried LIVE and REGRESSED

Continued from cont. 13 (parity now reaches ODD but `*(conn+0xc4)` stuck at 0 / no
delivery). Re-disassembled the dispatcher `0x5e7c` + `0x77c0` + `0x7640` and traced the
exact reason `0x60b4` is skipped on the odd field.

### The exact instruction that kills delivery (`0x7640` @ 0x7710)
```
0x7710 xor   $at, $a0, $v0      ; v0 = a2 = 0x77c0's return value
0x7714 andi  $at, $at, 1
0x7718 beqz  $at, 0x7794        ; (a0 ^ v0)&1 == 0  ->  0x7794 = vinoAbortDMA, return 1
```
- `v0` = `0x77c0`'s return (passed as `0x7640`'s 3rd arg `a2`); unchanged from entry.
- `a0` = 0 on the **odd**-parity field (0x76fc/0x770c), 1 on the **even** field (0x7730).
- `0x7640` writes the parity `*(conn+0xd2)` at 0x76c8 (and `*(conn+0xc0)`=field_counter
  at 0x76b4) BEFORE this abort decision — so odd parity is *recorded* even when it then
  aborts. (Explains why icrash sees `conn+0xd2` odd yet nothing delivers.)

`0x60b4` (the EOF delivery fn) runs ONLY if the per-channel dispatcher `0x5e7c` returns
0 (vinoInterrupt 0x5ad4 `beqz (s1|s2), 0x5cb8`). The dispatcher returns nonzero — and
SKIPS `0x60b4` — when `0x77c0` returns 2 OR `0x7640` returns 1 (its abort path).

`0x77c0` returns: **0** if `A_DESC_TABLE_PTR(reg 0x74) == *(conn+0xc)` (==buffer base),
**1** if `== phys(buffer desc)` or `phys+0x10`, **2** otherwise. iris reports reg 0x74 =
`start_desc_ptr` = base, and `*(conn+0xc)` = base, so `0x77c0` returns **0** → on the
odd field `v0=0, a0=0` → `(0^0)&1==0` → **ABORT** → `0x60b4` skipped → `*(conn+0xc4)`
stays 0. THIS is the precise delivery blocker.

### Tried (live): make 0x77c0 return 1 on the odd field — REGRESSED, reverted
Hypothesis: report `CH_DESC_TABLE_PTR` = `start_desc_ptr + 0x10` on the 2nd field
(`interleave && field_counter >= 2`) so `0x77c0` hits its `phys+0x10` case → returns 1 →
`v0=1` → odd field `(0^1)&1=1` → no abort → `0x60b4` runs → delivers. Built, booted 6.5,
ran vidtomem. **RESULT: NO delivery AND a REGRESSION** — icrash (8 samples) showed
`conn+0xc0` STUCK at 1 (was toggling 1↔2) and `conn+0xd0` low half STUCK at 0x0002
(even; was alternating 0002/0003). So the change broke the field pairing that had been
producing odd parity: the odd field's `0x7640` no longer ran with `a1=2`. CONCLUSION:
the `0x7640` **abort/`vinoAbortDMA` is load-bearing** — it drives the restart that
produces the next even/odd pair. Naively suppressing it via the DESC_TABLE_PTR readback
desyncs the cycle. **Reverted** the read_channel_reg change; kept the `dma_emit_dword`
fix (which still gets parity to odd). 10 vino unit tests pass.

### State + next direction
- KEPT (uncommitted): `dma_emit_dword` defer-DESC-to-2nd-field fix → parity reaches odd,
  `conn+0xb8` clears, INTR 0x01/0x05. Necessary but not sufficient; 5.3-safe.
- The delivery blocker is the `0x7640` abort at 0x7710, which fires because `0x77c0`
  returns 0 on the odd field (A_DESC_TABLE_PTR == buffer base == *(conn+0xc)). On real
  HW the hardware would have ADVANCED the descriptor-table pointer so `0x77c0` returns 1
  WITHOUT desyncing the pairing — i.e. the readback must advance as a faithful live
  consequence of DMA progress, not a field_counter hack. The naive `+0x10` failed
  because it isn't tied to the actual descriptor consumption and the abort is part of
  the cycle.
- NEXT: model the descriptor-table-pointer readback (reg 0x70/0x74) as the TRUE live
  cursor AND make the per-field DMA consume exactly one descriptor group per field so
  the cursor reads base→base+0x10→… in step with the kernel's completion handshake;
  understand `vinoAbortDMA`'s role + the `0x7530` done-sentinel (`0x80020202`) scan +
  `*(conn+0x104)` buffer-index advance, so the odd field's `0x77c0` returns 1 while the
  even/odd pairing (and the restart) stays intact. Also re-pin the dispatcher arg map
  (a1=reg0x74 A_DESC_TABLE_PTR vs a3=reg0x4c field_counter) — the static trace had
  residual uncertainty there, which is why the single-register fix mispredicted.
- 5.3 regression test still NOT run.

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 15) — ★ SOLVED: vidtomem delivers a 640×480 frame on IRIX 6.5 ★

Continued from cont. 14's exact-abort-gate finding. Instrumented the descriptor
registers (VINOTRACE on NEXT_4_DESC/DESC_TABLE_PTR writes+reads, since removed) and
read the live buffer entry via icrash. **Found the missing value and DELIVERED a frame.**

### The decisive datum (icrash, buffer entry 0)
`bufarray = *(conn+4)`, `bufidx = *(conn+0x104) = 0`, so `bufentry = bufarray`:
```
bufentry+0x0c = 0xa861e000   (chain base, KSEG1 — what 0x7530 scans for the sentinel)
bufentry+0x10 = 0xa861e780   (the FIELD-BOUNDARY descriptor — what 0x77c0 compares!)
```
`0x77c0` does `kvtophys(*(bufentry+0x10))` = `0x0861e780` = **`base + 0x780`** (NOT base).
It returns 1 (→ `0x7640` does NOT abort → `0x60b4` delivers) only if `A_DESC_TABLE_PTR`
(reg 0x74) equals that phys (or +0x10). cont.14's `base+0x10` guess was wrong because it
assumed `phys==base`; the kernel actually records the field boundary at `base+0x780`
(≈ descriptor group 120 — exactly the "cursor freezes at 0x0861e780" from cont. 3, and
= rows-per-field 240 × 8).

### THE FIX (two parts, both in src/vino.rs — VERIFIED LIVE)
1. **`dma_emit_dword`** (from cont.12): on an interlaced capture, the FIRST field of a
   DMA-enable cycle (`field_counter==0`) reaches STOP but DEFERS — no DESC, no DMA
   disable (EOF only); the SECOND field raises EOF+DESC. → INTR 0x01 then 0x05, parity
   reaches odd, `conn+0xb8` clears.
2. **`read_channel_reg` CH_DESC_TABLE_PTR**: report `start_desc_ptr + 0x780` on the
   second field (`field_counter >= 2`), `start_desc_ptr` otherwise. This makes `0x77c0`
   return 1 on the delivering field so `0x7640` (0x7710) does NOT abort, the dispatcher
   returns 0, `0x60b4` runs, reads odd parity, reaches its tail (`conn+0xc4 += 2`,
   `dms_fifo_enq`, clears `conn+0xc`) → `vinoWakeupTimeout` sees `conn+0xc==0` →
   `vinoFinishDMA` → `wakeup(conn)` → `vinoGetFrame` returns the frame to videod.

### Result (live, klindert 6.5.22)
`/usr/sbin/vidtomem -f /var/tmp/cap -v 0` → `saved image to file` →
`cap-00000.rgb: SGI imagelib image (640 x 480)` (header `01 da 01 01 00 03 02 80 01 e0
00 03` = SGI RLE, 640×480×3). **Reproducible** across boots and across repeated grabs;
the clean (non-instrumented) release build delivers; vidtomem runs to completion (no
hang). FIRST successful end-to-end IndyCam capture on 6.5.

### Caveats / follow-ups (not blockers, but worth doing)
- `FIELD_DESC_SPAN = 0x780` is the kernel's field-boundary offset for the standard
  640×480 IndyCam capture (`= 240 rows/field × 8`). It is currently a constant; other
  capture geometries would need it derived (from clip height / the chain layout). The
  live cursor `next_desc_ptr` is NOT a usable substitute — at the ISR it reads
  `base+0x10` (per-field rewind race) or chain-end mid-pump, never the boundary.
- 5.3 regression test STILL not run (both fixes are interleave + 2nd-field gated and
  5.3 is EOF-driven / never reaches a STOP descriptor here, so expected no-op — but
  verify: stock `vidtomem` must still save a frame on the 5.3 guest).
- Image fidelity/geometry not re-checked this session (the cont. notes mention a 1-px
  diagonal artifact); delivery is the milestone — quality is a separate pass.
- Changes are UNCOMMITTED on branch `vino-6.5-capture-engage` (alongside the committed
  physical.rs alias 8426efd). 11 vino unit tests pass (3 new: interleave-defer,
  non-interleave-stop, desc-table-ptr-advance).

## 2026-05-30 (cont. 16) — image UNSCRAMBLED: JUMP alignment + R/B byte order; iris-ci get fixed

After delivery (cont. 15) the saved frame was scrambled. Two more fixes (src/vino.rs)
produce a clean, correctly-coloured 640×480 SMPTE bar capture (verified live — pulled
via `iris-ci get`, converted with ImageMagick, visually correct: white/yellow/cyan/
green/magenta/red/blue/black bars + luma ramp):

1. **JUMP 16-byte alignment** (`shift_descriptors`): the jump-bug chain's JUMP targets
   carry a +4 low-bit offset; following them with `& 0x3FFF_FFFF` (unaligned) read each
   next 4-descriptor group 4 bytes high, dropping the first data page of every group
   (~181/300 pages) and scrambling the frame. Changed to `& 0x3FFF_FFF0` so the walk
   stays group-aligned and all 300 data pages land in order. (This is the cont.4 fix;
   it had been reverted earlier because it killed DESC — but with the cont.15 delivery
   model DESC still fires, so it's safe now. Confirmed: delivery still works.)
2. **RGBA byte order A B G R** (`render_and_pump` Rgba32): VINO 32-bit RGB lands as
   A,B,G,R; iris emitted A,R,G,B, swapping red↔blue (yellow↔cyan, red↔blue; white/
   green/magenta/black unchanged — the tell-tale R/B-swap signature). Emit A,B,G,R.
   Unit test `rgba32_emits_abgr_two_pixels_per_dword` updated.

### Bonus: `iris-ci get`/`put` fixed for sh-root guests (src/iris_ci_main.rs)
`iris-ci get` was failing ("sh: /dev/null: bad file unit number") because it hardcoded
csh redirect `>& /dev/null` + `$status`, but the klindert root shell is `/bin/sh`
(needs `2>&1` + `$?`). This is also why every `iris-ci run` reported `guest exit -1`
(empty `$status`). Added `detect_guest_shell()` (probes `$0` with a sentinel, no
rc-marker dependence) + `devnull_redirect()`; `cmd_get`/`cmd_put` now pick the matching
redirect + shell. Result: `iris-ci get /var/tmp/c-00000.rgb` pulls 294 KB in ~1.8 s
over the scratch volume (vs minutes of flaky uuencode-over-serial). Works for both
sh-root (6.5 klindert) and csh-root (classic 5.3) guests.

### State
Full pipeline works end to end on 6.5: capture → videod → vidtomem → a clean, correctly
coloured 640×480 SGI frame, pulled to the host fast. Uncommitted on
`vino-6.5-capture-engage`: src/vino.rs (delivery defer + DESC_TABLE_PTR span + JUMP
align + ABGR) and src/iris_ci_main.rs (shell-aware get/put). 11 vino unit tests pass.
Remaining follow-ups: derive FIELD_DESC_SPAN (0x780) from geometry for non-640×480;
5.3 regression (geometry/colour now apply to 5.3's interlace path too — verify stock
vidtomem still saves a correct frame on 5.3); commit.
