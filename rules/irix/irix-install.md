# Installing IRIX on iris (from scratch)

Covers **IRIX 5.3 for Indy** and **IRIX 6.5.22**. Where the two diverge
the differences are called out inline as **5.3:** / **6.5.22:** notes.

Adapted from <https://sgi.neocities.org/installguide> (which targets MAME)
with the corrections and shortcuts we found running it through iris.

## What you need

- `iris` built with `--features chd,camera,lightning` (the WD33C93 +
  HPC3 fixes for the miniroot install path are part of mainline now;
  see `rules/irix/miniroot-install-hang-scsi0-dma-irq-storm.md`).
- An **empty** boot disk at SCSI ID 1.
  - **6.5.22:** uncompressed CHD ≥ 4 GB. Create with `chdman`
    (Homebrew: `brew install rom-tools`):

    ```bash
    # 20 GB uncompressed CHD — sparse on disk (~20 MB used until written)
    chdman createhd -o irix65.chd -s 21474836480 -ss 512 -c none
    ```

    iris auto-creates a `.diff.chd` sidecar next to compressed parents;
    uncompressed CHDs are written in place, which is what you want for
    a fresh install (no sidecar accumulation).
  - **5.3:** an uncompressed CHD as well — **always use a CHD, never a
    raw file.** 5.3 fits comfortably in 4 GB, so the CHD can be smaller
    than the 6.5.22 one, but the format is the same and keeps the disk
    path, snapshot, and `.diff.chd` tooling uniform across both
    versions. Create with `chdman`:

    ```bash
    # 4 GB uncompressed CHD — sparse on disk (~few MB used until written)
    chdman createhd -o irix53.chd -s 4294967296 -ss 512 -c none
    ```

    As with 6.5.22, an uncompressed CHD is written in place (no
    `.diff.chd` sidecar), which is what you want for a fresh install.

- `prom.bin` is **not** required — iris falls back to an embedded PROM
  image when the file is missing. You'll see one line at startup:
  `Warning: Could not read PROM file 'prom.bin': ... — using embedded PROM`.
- Install ISOs:
  - **6.5.22:** six (seven with Dev Foundation) ISOs. The names below
    are the SGI 6.5.22 release-kit labels, typically on disk under
    `irix/`:
    - Installation Tools and Overlays (1 of 3) ← bootable (miniroot +
      fx.ARCS + sashARCS) — the "Overlay 1" the recipe refers to
    - Overlays (2 of 3)
    - Overlays (3 of 3)
    - IRIX 6.5 Applications November 2003
    - IRIX 6.5 Foundation 1
    - IRIX 6.5 Foundation 2
    - IRIX Development Foundation 1.3 (optional — not in the recipe)

    If your filenames differ, edit the `discs = [...]` list in the
    toml to match. A clean template lives at `iris-irix65.toml`.
  - **5.3:** a single CD covers everything 5.3 ever shipped on Indy:
    `IRIX 5.3 for Indy.iso`. No CD swapping during the *base* install.
    Template at `iris-irix53.toml`.
  - **5.3 — Developer's Toolbox 6.0 (recommended, if available):** the
    three `Developers Toolbox 6.0 Disc {1,2,3}.iso` CDs. **If you have
    them, install them too** (see section 11) — they carry the GNU
    toolchain (`gcc`, `binutils`, `gdb`, `bash`, …), the SGI Freeware
    1.0/2.0 collection (emacs, perl5, python, tcl/tk, ghostscript,
    netpbm, samba, netscape, …) and SGI dev kits (Open Inventor dev,
    GLUT, `compiler_dev`, `dmedia_dev`). They are EFS distribution CDs
    (`sgilabel` header, not ISO9660) installed from the booted system
    via `inst`, *after* the base 5.3 install reboots. List all four
    discs in the `[scsi.4]` changer so they can be cycled in with
    `iris-ci cdrom-eject 4` — see the config and section 11 below.

## Install config

Keep the install config separate from your day-to-day `iris.toml` —
the install needs a different disk path, the CD changer order, and
specific PROM env tweaks, and you don't want any of those bleeding
into normal operation. Two ready-to-edit templates live at the repo
root: `iris-irix53.toml` for 5.3, `iris-irix65.toml` for 6.5.22.
Launch with `--config <file> --ci --ci-display`.

> ⚠️ **`headless = false` is mandatory for the install — both
> versions.** With `headless = true`, iris doesn't map REX3 and
> miniroot's hinv records `GFXBOARD=SERVER`. Inst then applies its
> `RGFXBOARD!=SERVER` tag filters and strips every Newport-specific

> miniroot needs to see.

The disk goes at SCSI 1, CD (or CD changer) at SCSI 4. `[vino]
source = "camera"` is fine for the install.

**6.5.22:** CD changer on SCSI 4 with Overlay 1 active and the rest
in cycle order:

```toml
headless    = false
no_audio    = false
banks       = [128, 128, 0, 0]
# Per-config NVRAM so the 5.3 and 6.5 PROM env don't collide.
nvram       = "nvram-irix65.bin"
serial_log  = "irix-install-console.log"

[scsi.1]
path  = "irix65.chd"
cdrom = false

# Adjust the paths below to match your actual ISO filenames.
[scsi.4]
path  = "irix/IRIX 6.5.22 Installation Tools and Overlays (1 of 3).iso"
cdrom = true
discs = [
  "irix/IRIX 6.5.22 Installation Tools and Overlays (1 of 3).iso",
  "irix/IRIX 6.5.22 Overlays (2 of 3).iso",
  "irix/IRIX 6.5.22 Overlays (3 of 3).iso",
  "irix/IRIX 6.5 Applications November 2003.iso",
  "irix/IRIX 6.5 Foundation 1.iso",
  "irix/IRIX 6.5 Foundation 2.iso",
]

[vino]
source = "camera"

[[port_forward]]
proto = "tcp"; host_port = 2323; guest_port = 23; bind = "localhost"
```

**5.3:** the base install only needs the single 5.3 CD, but list the
three Developer's Toolbox 6.0 discs in the `[scsi.4]` changer too (if
you have them) so they can be cycled in with `iris-ci cdrom-eject 4`
for the section 11 add-on install. The 5.3 CD stays first/active, so
the base install (sections 3-7) is unaffected by the extra discs. The
[scsi.2] scratch volume gives the host an out-of-band channel for
copying files in/out without networking; useful both during and
after install:

```toml
headless    = false
no_audio    = false
banks       = [128, 128, 0, 0]
# Per-config NVRAM so the 5.3 and 6.5 PROM env don't collide.
nvram       = "nvram-irix53.bin"
serial_log  = "irix-install-console.log"

[scsi.1]
path  = "irix53.chd"
cdrom = false

[scsi.2]
path    = "scratch.raw"
cdrom   = false
overlay = false
scratch = true
size_mb = 16

# 5.3 base CD active; Developer's Toolbox discs in the changer for
# the section 11 add-on install (omit the discs = [...] list if you
# don't have the Toolbox CDs). Adjust paths to your filenames.
[scsi.4]
path  = "irix53/IRIX 5.3 for Indy including R5000.iso"
cdrom = true
discs = [
  "irix53/IRIX 5.3 for Indy including R5000.iso",
  "irix53/Developers Toolbox 6.0 Disc 1.iso",
  "irix53/Developers Toolbox 6.0 Disc 2.iso",
  "irix53/Developers Toolbox 6.0 Disc 3.iso",
]

[vino]
source = "camera"

[[port_forward]]
proto = "tcp"; host_port = 2323; guest_port = 23; bind = "localhost"
```

## Driving the install

All commands go through `iris-ci`. Boot iris with `--ci --ci-display`
(the `--ci-display` keeps the Newport window visible alongside the
control socket, which is what allows miniroot to detect graphics).
The commands below use `$CFG` so the same shell session works for
either version:

```bash
export CFG=iris-irix53.toml   # or iris-irix65.toml
./target/release/iris --config "$CFG" --ci --ci-display \
    > /tmp/iris.stdout.log 2>&1 &
```

Then in another shell:

```bash
alias ic=./target/release/iris-ci
ic ping     # liveness check
ic start    # CPU thread does not auto-start in --ci mode
```

### Step 0 — start the prompt watcher (do this BEFORE sections 1-N)

> ⚠️ **The sections below show `iris-ci serial-wait` calls in their

**Avoid `serial-read` while a `serial-wait` is in flight on the same
socket** — they race and you'll see `connect /tmp/iris.sock: Resource
temporarily unavailable (os error 35)`. Pick one: drive entirely
through `inst-watch.py` events, or use only `serial-wait` between
sends.

**`tail -F … | grep` won't see prompts that have no trailing newline.**
The `Restart? { (y)es, (n)o, (sh)ell, (h)elp }:` line and a few others
are written without a `\n` because Inst is waiting for input on the
same line. `grep --line-buffered` still buffers until end-of-line, so a
`Monitor: tail -F | grep "Restart"` will silently miss the prompt and
only fire after you've already responded (the keystroke produces the
newline that flushes the line). Use `iris-ci serial-wait "Restart"`
for prompts of this shape — it scans the byte stream, not lines.
Prompts with this gotcha that have bitten this install: the `Restart?`
prompt above, `Are you sure? [y/n] (n):`, `Block size of filesystem
512 or 4096 bytes?`, `Install software from: [/CDROM/dist]`, fx's
`fx> ` and `fx/label/create> ` prompts, and the PROM monitor `>> `.

### 1. PROM env (one-time, with a small chicken-and-egg)

A fresh iris launch reads the NVRAM file named by `nvram` in your
config (defaults to `nvram.bin`; the templates above use a
per-version filename to keep the two installs from sharing PROM
env). If the file is missing or its
checksum is bad iris prints `NVRAM checksum is incorrect:
reinitializing.` on the serial console and resets the PROM env to
defaults — including `ConsoleIn=serial(0)`, but the PROM at that
point hasn't latched onto serial yet and `console` is unset (effective
`console=g`). With `headless = false` the graphics console takes
priority and **the serial channel is dead-eared until you've
explicitly set `console=d` in nvram and persisted it**. You can't do
that from the serial console because the PROM isn't listening.

So the bootstrap is a two-phase dance:

```bash
# Phase A: seed nvram via a one-shot headless boot so the serial
# console is the only console — sed the toml or use a separate
# config; restore after.
sed -i.bak 's/^headless    = false/headless    = true/' "$CFG"
./target/release/iris --config "$CFG" --ci \
    > /tmp/iris.stdout.log 2>&1 &
ic ping; ic start

# Wait for the System Maintenance Menu. The exact prompt is "Option?"
# (NOT "Stop for Maintenance" — that string never appears in iris's
# embedded-PROM serial output; the menu draws straight to "Option?").
ic serial-wait --timeout 60 "Option?"

ic serial-send "5"                # Command Monitor
ic serial-wait --timeout 10 ">> " # PROM monitor prompt
ic serial-send "setenv -f eaddr 08:00:69:de:ad:01"
ic serial-wait --timeout 10 ">> "
ic serial-send "setenv -f SystemPartition scsi(0)disk(1)rdisk(0)partition(8)"
ic serial-wait --timeout 10 ">> "
ic serial-send "setenv -f OSLoadPartition scsi(0)disk(1)rdisk(0)partition(0)"
ic serial-wait --timeout 10 ">> "
ic serial-send "setenv -f console d"   # routes output to serial
ic serial-wait --timeout 10 ">> "
ic rtc-save                            # persist nvram.bin — REQUIRED
ic quit

# Phase B: real install, headless=false so REX3 is mapped.
sed -i.bak 's/^headless    = true/headless    = false/' "$CFG"
./target/release/iris --config "$CFG" --ci --ci-display \
    > /tmp/iris.stdout.log 2>&1 &
ic ping; ic start

# The default PROM env has AutoLoad=Yes, so the PROM tries to chain-load
# sash from the (still unformatted) disk before falling through to the
# Maintenance Menu. You'll see:
#
#   No volume header on device: scsi(0)disk(1)rdisk(0)partition(8)/sash.
#   Unable to boot; press any key to continue:
#
# Send an empty line to advance past it, *then* wait for "Option?".
ic serial-wait --timeout 60 "Unable to boot"
ic serial-send ""
ic serial-wait --timeout 30 "Option?"
```

Once Phase A's `rtc-save` is in place, the Phase B PROM picks up
`console=d` at init and routes serial properly. If you happen to
have inherited an nvram.bin from an older `headless = true` run
where the *previous* PROM init flooded `MC: GIO Timeout at
1f0f1338`, those events stop accruing once the menu is up and don't
recur this session.

### 2. Label the disk via fx (one-time per fresh disk)

```bash
ic serial-send "5"
ic serial-send "boot -f dksc(0,4,8)sashARCS dksc(0,4,7)stand/fx.ARCS --x"
# accept three defaults (device-name dksc, ctlr 0, drive 1)
ic serial-send ""; ic serial-send ""; ic serial-send ""
# label/create/all  →  ..  →  sync  →  ..  →  exit
ic serial-send "l"; ic serial-send "c"; ic serial-send "a"
ic serial-send ".."; ic serial-send "sync"
ic serial-send ".."; ic serial-send "exit"
```

### 3. Install System Software → miniroot

```bash
ic serial-send "2"                # PROM "Install System Software"
ic serial-send ""                 # accept default Local CD-ROM 4
ic serial-send ""                 # confirm CD inserted (Overlay 1)
# wait ~2 min for miniroot kernel boot + Inst 4.1 Main Menu
ic serial-wait --timeout 300 "Inst>"
```

If the disk is truly empty (no XFS yet), miniroot will ask
`Make new file system on /dev/dsk/realroot [yes/no/sh/help]:` — answer
`yes`, then `y` to confirm, then **`4096`** for block size (the magic
number for ≥ 4 GB disks).

### 4. Turn off pagination and conflict-rules **first**

```bash
ic serial-send "set page_output off"     # no more "more?" pages
ic serial-send "set rulesoverride on"    # auto-resolve conflicts
```

These two settings are what makes the rest of the recipe a straight
shot. Without them you'll spend an hour resolving 71 + 62 + ... cascading
conflicts by hand — most of which are old-version-vs-new incompatibilities
inst would happily skip if you let it.

### 5. Load install distributions

**5.3:** single CD, single `from` invocation:

```bash
ic serial-send "from"
ic serial-send "1"                # /CDROM/dist
ic serial-wait --timeout 90 "Inst>"
```

The 5.3 inst doesn't ask the feature/maintenance question, doesn't
need any CD swapping, and finishes the catalog scan quickly. Skip to
section 6 once you're back at `Inst>`.

**6.5.22:** six CDs cycled through the changer. The order matters
because each CD is mounted as `/CDROM/dist` (or `/CDROM/dist/unbundled`
for Overlay 2's variant). Eject between each with `iris-ci
cdrom-eject 4`.

```bash
# Overlay 1 (already mounted) — Inst already pointed at /CDROM/dist
ic serial-send "from"
ic serial-send "1"                # /CDROM/dist
# README pager is auto-quit by step 4's "set page_output off" —
# do NOT send "q" (it would be interpreted as quit from the next prompt)
# stream choice (maintenance vs feature) — pick "feature" (2)
# inst-watch classifies this as numbered_choice
ic serial-send "2"
ic serial-wait --timeout 60 "Install software from:"

# Overlay 2  → /CDROM/dist/unbundled  (guide-special path)
ic cdrom-eject 4
ic serial-send "/CDROM/dist/unbundled"
ic serial-wait --timeout 180 "Install software from:"

# Overlay 3 → /CDROM/dist
ic cdrom-eject 4
ic serial-send "/CDROM/dist"
ic serial-wait --timeout 180 "Install software from:"

# Applications → /CDROM/dist
# (license-agreement pager auto-quits because step 4 set page_output off;
#  do NOT send "q" — at the "Install software from:" prompt it means quit
#  and pops you back to Inst> with only 4 CDs scanned)
ic cdrom-eject 4
ic serial-send "/CDROM/dist"
ic serial-wait --timeout 240 "Install software from:"

# Foundation 1 → /CDROM/dist
ic cdrom-eject 4
ic serial-send "/CDROM/dist"
ic serial-wait --timeout 180 "Install software from:"

# Foundation 2 → /CDROM/dist
ic cdrom-eject 4
ic serial-send "/CDROM/dist"
ic serial-wait --timeout 180 "Install software from:"

# Done scanning
ic serial-send "done"
ic serial-wait --timeout 30 "Inst>"
```

### 6. The package-selection recipe

**5.3:** the recipe is shorter (one CD, fewer subsystems). Pick the
full desktop install — `install *` selects everything on the CD
including the gfx_eoe / Newport graphics bits and the desktop stack
(4Dwm, mwm, IndigoMagic toolchest). Then `go`:

```bash
ic serial-send "install *"
ic serial-send "go"
```

If `go` reports conflicts (it shouldn't for a single-CD 5.3 install
on an empty disk, but it can if you tried a partial install
earlier), use the `Conflict resolution` appendix at the bottom of
this doc. There is no `Foundations 1.1` cross-CD prereq problem on
5.3 because everything is on one disc.

**6.5.22:** the sgi.neocities recipe verbatim — `keep *` then carve
out the standard set. With `rulesoverride on` from step 4,
conflicting older versions get auto-deselected during `go` so you
don't have to hand-resolve.

```bash
ic serial-send "keep *"
ic serial-send "install standard"
ic serial-send "keep java2_plugin.sw32.mozilla_freeware"
ic serial-send "keep inventor_dev.sw.base"
ic serial-send "keep inventor_dev.sw.lib"
ic serial-send "install eoe.sw.fonttools"
ic serial-send "install eoe.sw.uucp"
ic serial-send "install eoe.sw.xlv"
ic serial-send "install ftn_eoe"
ic serial-send "install eoe.sw.spell"
ic serial-send "install inventor_eoe.sw64"
ic serial-send "install ifl_eoe.sw64"
ic serial-send "install dmedia_eoe.sw64"      # "no matches" warning is fine
ic serial-send "install prereqs"
ic serial-send "keep incompleteoverlays"
ic serial-send "go"
```

### 7. The long bit

`go` runs the actual install. Expect 1–2 hours of emulated CPU
chewing through tar streams, writing to the XFS root. The installer
will prompt to swap CDs ("Please insert the `<NAME>` CD."); answer
by cycling the changer until the requested ISO is mounted, then
press Enter:

```bash
# Cycle the SCSI 4 changer until the wanted disc is mounted.
want='Foundation 1'    # match a substring of the requested CD's filename
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6; do
  cur=$(ic cdrom-eject 4 | sed -E 's/.*new_disc":"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
  echo "now mounted: $cur"
  case "$cur" in *"$want"*) break ;; esac
done
ic serial-send ""
```

If you happen to advance past the requested disc, just keep going —
the changer wraps around. A spurious "You've inserted the incorrect
CD." print is normal while the changer is cycling under the
installer's polling; once the right ISO is mounted the install
resumes automatically.

When `go` finishes you're dropped back at the Inst> prompt — not the
Restart prompt. The success signal in the log is one line:

```
Installations and removals were successful.
```

From Inst>, send `quit`. This triggers:

1. A non-fatal `ERROR: INCOMPATIBLE SUBSYSTEMS INSTALLED` print —
   harmless because step 4 set `rulesoverride on` (the message even
   says "Exit allowed because rulesoverride option is set").
2. A several-minute `Requickstarting ELF files (rqsall(1))` pass that
   walks the entire installed tree (CHD grows another ~50–100 MB).
3. An autoconfig pass (`Automatically reconfiguring the operating
   system.`).
4. Finally, the actual restart prompt — and it's `Restart? { (y)`,
   not the `Restart the system. (y/n)?` the SGI guide shows.

```bash
ic serial-send "quit"
ic serial-wait --timeout 900 "Restart"
ic serial-send "y"
```

### 8. First multi-user boot

After the post-install restart, the PROM goes straight through
`AutoLoad=Yes` and chains into the installed sash → /unix → init.
You don't see the Maintenance Menu at all on this first boot; you'll
see the standard sysadm shell up + a sequence of one-time warnings
that aren't fatal:

```
network: WARNING: IRIS's Internet address is the default.
Using standalone network mode.
UX:mv: ERROR: /etc/resolv.conf - No such file or directory
Warning:  Internet Gateway web server running as root.

IRIS console login:
```

The `UX:mv: ERROR: /etc/resolv.conf` is the standalone-network
bring-up trying to swap in a dhclient resolv.conf and finding none;
it's cosmetic on a clean install. Configure networking later if you
want to silence it.

Log in as `root` (no password yet); `iris-ci login` handles the
`TERM = (vt100)` dismissal automatically:

```bash
ic login
ic run "uname -a; df -k / | tail -1"
```

At this point the system boots and runs, but the framebuffer is
still dark — Phase A left `console=d` in the PROM env, so all
output goes to ttyd1. Continue to section 9 to clean up the
volume header, then section 10 to switch to `console=g` and bring
up the desktop. (**5.3** and **6.5.22** follow the same section 10
procedure — only the underlying filesystem differs, EFS vs XFS.)

### 9. Remove the miniroot install stub from the volume header

After the install completes, the SGI volume header on the boot disk
still has an `ide` entry alongside `sash`:

```
IRIS # dvhtool -v list /dev/rdsk/dks0d1vh

Current contents:
        File name        Length     Block #
        ide              343040           2
        sash             343040         672
```

`ide` is the miniroot installer image. Sash checks for it on every boot
and prints

```
It appears that a miniroot install failed.  Either the system is
misconfigured or a previous installation failed.
...
Enter 'c' to continue with no state fixup.
Enter 'f' to fix miniroot install state, and try again
Enter 'a' to abort and return to menu.
```

even though the install actually succeeded — selecting `f` resets the
in-progress flag but the next boot puts it back because the `ide` blob
is still in the volume header. Remove it once and the prompt is gone
for good:

```
IRIS # dvhtool -v delete ide /dev/rdsk/dks0d1vh
IRIS # dvhtool -v list /dev/rdsk/dks0d1vh

Current contents:
        File name        Length     Block #
        sash             343040         672
```

You don't lose anything you'll miss — to reinstall later you'd boot
from a CD anyway, which writes a fresh `ide` for that session.

### 10. Switch to the graphical console (Indigo Magic Desktop)

Applies to both **5.3** and **6.5.22**. After the install you're
still booting with `console=d` (PROM env from Phase A), so kernel
messages and the IRIS login prompt come out on serial and the
framebuffer is dark even though `xdm` is enabled. This section flips
the PROM env to `console=g` so the boot path renders to the Newport
window and xdm draws the graphical login.

Follow the steps in this section if you ran Phase B with `headless =
false` (the recommended path for both versions). The install brought
in the desktop stack (`x_eoe`, `desktop_eoe`, 4Dwm, the toolchest)
and turned `desktop`/`visuallogin`/`xdm` on by default; the
switchover is just a PROM-env flip plus a clean halt:

```bash
# 1) From the IRIX shell: enable the X server + tell the PROM to use
#    graphics console.
ic run "chkconfig windowsystem on"
ic run "nvram console g"

# 2) Persist the emulated NVRAM to the host file named by `nvram` in
#    your toml (default nvram.bin). Without this the console=g change
#    lives only in iris's in-memory NVRAM and evaporates when iris
#    exits — the next launch reads the stale on-disk NVRAM and you're
#    back to console=d. This applies to any PROM env change made from
#    inside IRIX (nvram(1)) or from the PROM monitor (setenv). With no
#    `path` arg, `rtc-save` writes to the configured file.
ic rtc-save

# 3) Cleanly halt so the filesystem (XFS on 6.5.22, EFS on 5.3) is
#    synced. `halt -y` does NOT return to the PROM Maintenance Menu
#    in either version — IRIX puts up a graphical "Okay to power off
#    the system now. Press any key to restart." dialog on the
#    framebuffer and stops writing to the serial console. So
#    `serial-wait` for "Maintenance Menu" will timeout silently.
#    Take screenshots until you see the dialog, then either click
#    Restart (in the visible window) or quit iris and relaunch.
ic run "halt -y"
# Snapshot the framebuffer every few seconds; open the PNG and look
# for the "Okay to power off…" panel before quitting iris. A poll
# loop drives the timing — visual confirmation is the gating step,
# this guide can't OCR for you.
for i in $(seq 1 20); do
    sleep 3
    ic screenshot /tmp/halted-$i.png
done
# Inspect /tmp/halted-*.png — once you see the dialog, iris is safe
# to quit (or click Restart in the window to chain straight into a
# fresh boot).
ic quit
```

Now use a non-headless config for the launch. Simplest: in
`$CFG`, remove `headless = true` (or set it `false`). The daily-use
`iris.toml` is fine to keep for other disks.

```bash
./target/release/iris --config "$CFG" \
    > /tmp/iris.stdout.log 2>&1 &
```

iris pops a Newport window; the PROM runs through AutoLoad and
chains into the installed kernel; xdm draws the graphical login
manager. (If you want the CI socket alongside the visible window,
launch with `--ci --ci-display` instead — that keeps `iris-ci`
usable at the cost of ~10–15 fps render rate.)

To verify from the host without looking at the window:

```bash
ic login
ic run "ps -ef | grep -E 'Xsgi|4Dwm|toolchest' | grep -v grep"
ic screenshot /tmp/desktop.png   # only with --ci-display
```

### 11. Install the Developer's Toolbox 6.0 CDs (5.3, optional)

Only for **5.3**, and only if you have the three `Developers Toolbox
6.0 Disc {1,2,3}.iso` discs (they're in the `[scsi.4]` changer from the
config above). Unlike the base OS, these install from the **booted**
system — no miniroot.

> ⚠️ **These CDs are NOT a flat `inst` distribution.** They are an SGI
> "sifttree" — a web-browsable tree (`/CDROM/index.html`,
> `/CDROM/toolbox/…`), not a `/CDROM/dist`. Two distinct kinds of
> content:
>
> - **SGI-packaged inst images** live under
>   `/CDROM/toolbox/inst/` — a per-disc "1-stop-shop" of symlinks to
>   the real product trees on that disc. **This is what you point
>   `inst` at.** Contents across the three discs (resident per disc):
>   Disc 1 `DevDriver` (driver books), `glut_dev` (GLUT 3.0),
>   `oasisIII` (help); Disc 2 `emacs19`(+contrib), `frame`
>   (FrameMaker 4.0.3), `insight_dev`, `inst_dev` (swpkg),
>   `netscape` (Navigator 2.01S), `psgl`; Disc 3 `gvi`,
>   `speechManager`, `speech_dev`, `uucpVadmin`.
> - **The SGI Freeware 1.0/2.0 collection** (GNU toolchain, perl,
>   python, tcl/tk, ghostscript, …) lives under
>   `/CDROM/toolbox/public/freeware{1,2}.0/` as per-product trees
>   (Software Manager / `.tardist`), and its precompiled binaries are
>   oriented at IRIX **6.2** (`/CDROM/toolbox/dist/6.2/`). On 5.3 the
>   freeware is largely not cleanly installable; skip it. The steps
>   below install only the SGI-packaged items.

**Do this while serial is still the console** — i.e. after section 9
and *before* section 10's `console=g` switch — so `iris-ci` can drive
`inst` over ttyd1. (After section 10 you'd instead open a terminal in
the Indigo Magic desktop.) The system must be at multi-user.

**Two iris-specific gotchas before the recipe:**

1. **`cdrom-eject 4` swaps the ISO at the SCSI layer but `mediad` does
   NOT auto-remount `/CDROM`** — it keeps the stale mount of the
   previous disc. After every eject you must unmount and re-mount by
   hand:

   ```bash
   ic cdrom-eject 4
   ic run "umount /CDROM"
   ic run "mount -t efs -o ro /dev/dsk/dks0d4s7 /CDROM"
   ```

2. **The IRIX root shell is csh** — no `2>`, no `for/do/done`, no
   `if/then/fi`. Use `egrep` (5.3 `grep` lacks `-E`). A botched
   sh-style multi-line command drops csh to a `? ` continuation that
   Ctrl-C will NOT break — send Ctrl-D (`serial-send --no-cr $'\004'`)
   to force-evaluate the block. See `rules/`/memory for details.

The changer *starts* on the 5.3 base CD, so eject once to reach
Toolbox Disc 1, then repeat the block below for each of the three
discs (replacing `dev_books`/`oasisIII` skips as noted):

```bash
ic login
ic cdrom-eject 4
ic run "umount /CDROM"
ic run "mount -t efs -o ro /dev/dsk/dks0d4s7 /CDROM"
ic run "ls -L /CDROM/toolbox/inst/*.idb"   # see which products are resident

ic serial-send "inst -f /CDROM/toolbox/inst"   # NOT /CDROM/dist
# at Inst> (keep inst-watch.py running):
ic serial-send "set page_output off"
ic serial-send "install *"
ic serial-send "go"
```

**Resolving the conflicts (`go` will report them).** Every conflict is
some toolbox dev piece whose prereq isn't present, or a newer toolbox
version of a base component. The base 5.3 install has **no IDO**
(`dev.sw.make`, `dev.hdr.lib`) and no `gl_dev`/`inventor_dev`, so the
dependent pieces can't install. Pick the **"Do not install"** option
for each (the system is consistent without them). Examples seen:

- `glut_dev.sw*.dev` / `.fortran` / `.src.inventor` → need
  `gl_dev`/`inventor_dev` → choose `Na` (do not install). This
  cascades (fortran→dev) for a round or two; keep choosing `Na`.
- `sgihelp_dev.sw.xhelp`, `insight_dev.sw.rules` → need IDO
  `dev.sw.make`/`dev.hdr.lib` → `Na`.
- `netscape.plugin.{MediaWH,Inventor}` → need `media_warehouse` /
  `inventor_eoe` → `Na`.
- `sgihelp_dev.sw.{xhelp,dev}` would replace base `insight` bits →
  choose the **"Do not install"** sub-option to keep the base intact.

```bash
ic serial-send "conflicts 1a 2a 3a 4a …"   # one Na per conflict, then:
ic serial-send "go"
```

**Handling bad archives.** Two files are damaged/absent in these
images and abort `go` with an `Error/Interrupt Menu`:

- `oasisIII.man` — **missing on all three discs** (`Stat failed`).
- `dev_books.books` — **corrupt on Disc 2** (`checksum is …`).

`continue` (3) only steps one file at a time and loops on a missing
archive, so the clean fix is to **stop the command and deselect the
whole product**:

```bash
# at the Interrupt> menu:
ic serial-send "2"                 # stop (already-installed subsystems persist)
ic serial-send "2"                 # "Execute the current exit-commands"
# back at Inst>:
ic serial-send "keep oasisIII"     # and/or: keep dev_books
ic serial-send "go"                # installs the remaining good subsystems
```

If the bad product is the *last* subsystem (oasisIII.man often is),
you can just `stop` and skip straight to quit.

**Finish each disc:**

```bash
ic serial-send "quit"
ic serial-send "yes"               # "products marked … really quit?" → yes
```

After all three discs, confirm what landed:

```bash
ic run "versions | egrep -i 'emacs|netscape|glut|gvi|speech|frame|insight_dev|inst_dev|DevDriver|oasisIII|uucpVadmin'"
```

Notes:
- A clean run installs `DevDriver`, `emacs19`(+contrib), `frame`,
  `glut_dev` (runtime/docs/examples/demos), `gvi`, `insight_dev`,
  `inst_dev`, `netscape` (+plugins), `oasisIII`, `speechManager`,
  `speech_dev`, `uucpVadmin`.
- `emacs19` here is the SGI-packaged inst image (full GNU Emacs 19.28
  with sources, VM, crypt) — it's part of `toolbox/inst`, distinct
  from the skipped Freeware collection.
- These are add-ons; nothing here touches the volume header or PROM
  env, so no `dvhtool`/`rtc-save` follow-up is needed.

## Conflict resolution without `rulesoverride on`

The sgi.neocities recipe assumes `rulesoverride on` so inst silently drops
packages whose prerequisites can't be met from the loaded CDs. That works
but it leaves you with no record of *what* got skipped. The honest path is:

```bash
ic serial-send "set page_output off"
# Skip 'set rulesoverride on'.  Use the parser instead.
```

When `go` returns `ERROR: Conflicts must be resolved.`, dump the
conflicts list, run it through `tools/inst-resolve.py`, and pipe the
result back in:

```bash
ic serial-send "conflicts"
sleep 8
ic serial-read > /tmp/conf.txt
python3 tools/inst-resolve.py < /tmp/conf.txt > /tmp/resolve.txt 2> /tmp/skipped.txt
cat /tmp/skipped.txt    # which packages are getting skipped + why
while IFS= read -r line; do
  ic serial-send "$line"
  sleep 2
done < /tmp/resolve.txt
ic serial-send "go"
```

The resolver picks the highest-letter option (`c` over `b` over `a`)
whose text doesn't mention "from an additional distribution" or
"Open new distribution" — i.e. an option whose prereqs are on one of
the already-scanned distributions. Falls back to `a` (don't install)
only when nothing else works, and *reports* every fallback.

If `tools/inst-resolve.py` reports any fallback at all, that's your
signal that the install isn't complete for the recipe as written —
some product wanted a prereq that isn't on any loaded CD.

## Known missing CD: 6.5.22-era Foundations 1.1

With the 7 CDs in `irix/6.5.22/` listed above, `tools/inst-resolve.py`
falls back on a ~40-package set whose required base versions are
`1274627340` (e.g. `eoe.sw.base`, `eoe.sw.gfx`, `x_eoe.sw.eoe`, etc.).
That version is the **2002–2003 Foundations 1.1 refresh** that SGI
shipped alongside the 6.5.22 media kit. Our `IRIX-6.5-Foundation1.iso`
is the original 1998 Foundation 1 with version `1274627333`, which is
too old for the 6.5.22 overlays.

We have a `Foundations 1.1.iso` in `irix/6.5.29/` but the 6.5.22
miniroot's inst rejects it with `ERROR: This software distribution is
not meant to install on the version of IRIX currently running on this
machine.` — SGI rev'd it for each release wave.

**To get a fully clean install you need the IRIX 6.5 Foundations 1.1
CD from the 6.5.22 media kit specifically** (look for an ISO dated
late 2002 / 2003 with the "1.1" label, not the 6.5.29-era one).

Without it, the install still completes a *core* 6.5.22 base
(Overlays + Apps that don't depend on the missing base versions) but
loses these optionals:

- `eoe.sw.{base,gfx,gifts_perl}` overlay updates
- `x_eoe.sw.{eoe,plugin}` overlay updates
- `motif21_dev`, `ViewKit21_dev`
- `cosmoplayer`, `netscape`, `mozilla`, `appletalk`, `arraysvcs`
- `performer_eoe.sw.performer` (demo)
- `media_warehouse` viewers
- `il_eoe.sw.{c++,vk}`, `ifl_eoe.sw.c++`
- `webviewer`, `infosearch`, `sysmon` desktop pieces

## Iris-specific gotchas

- **`headless = false` + `console=d` is the correct install combo,
  not `headless = true`.** Earlier versions of this guide ran the
  install with `headless = true` to avoid needing a window — that
  produces a degraded install (see the warning at the top of section
  10). Use `headless = false` so REX3 is mapped (miniroot probes
  Newport correctly and inst's `RGFXBOARD!=SERVER` filters don't
  strip Xsgi etc.), and keep `console=d` so the inst dialog routes
  to ttyd1 where `iris-ci` can drive it. With REX3 mapped, the old
  failure mode here (`MC: GIO Timeout at 1f0f1338` flood, UTLB miss
  at PC `0x97f9c39c`/`0x1c`) doesn't happen: the PROM finds a real
  graphics device to back the `console=g`-era pointers even though
  we're routing output to serial. Setting `console=d` mid-session
  with `setenv -f` still requires an `rtc-save` (see the next bullet)
  so the value survives an iris restart.
- **fx defaults** are correct on iris; `label/create/all` writes a
  standard SGI volume header with a root partition that mkfs will
  later format as XFS.
- **`scsi eject 4`** vs `iris-ci cdrom-eject 4` are the same thing.
  Use the iris-ci form so it's scriptable.

## Driving the installer reliably

The Inst program is interactive and emits prompts that don't always
match `serial-wait` patterns cleanly. Two things bite hard:

1. **Catalog rescans at the same path REPLACE, they don't accumulate**
   — but only if you've already made selections. The "from" loop in
   step 5 must scan all six CDs *before* any `install`/`keep` command
   runs. Once a selection exists, re-entering the same path
   (`/CDROM/dist`) inside `from` prompts:

   ```
   There are products marked for installation or removal.
   Switching distributions will cause the selections to be lost.
   Do you really want to switch distributions? (y/n)
   ```

   Answering `y` discards the prior catalog at that path. The doc's
   `from`-loop is structured so all six CDs are scanned before any
   selection — keep it that way. If you `done` out of the `from` loop
   too early and then `from` again, you will hit this prompt for every
   CD you swap in at `/CDROM/dist` and end up with only the last CD's
   catalog. Symptom: `install eoe.sw.fonttools` returns "No matches"
   for core eoe packages from Overlay 1.

2. **`serial-wait` for `"Install software from:"` matches stale
   buffer**, since that prompt persists across CD-load iterations. Wait
   for `"100% Done\\."` (emitted exactly once per scan completion)
   between CDs instead. And never drain the buffer with `serial-read`
   while a `serial-wait` is in flight against the same socket — it
   competes with the wait's stream and the wait will time out even
   after the pattern has appeared.

3. **Catch *all* prompt shapes proactively.** A narrow `tail -F | grep
   -E "100% Done|Install software from:"` will miss `(y/n)`,
   `Please enter a choice [1]:`, license-agreement `Press <Enter>`,
   and `Inst>` returns. Use a wider filter that emits on any of:
   `100% Done`, `Install software from:`, `Inst>` at EOL, `(y/n)`,
   `Press` + `Enter`, `Please enter`, `[yes/no`, `Restart the system`,
   `Insert.*press`, `ERROR:`, `Conflicts`, `PANIC|Exception`, lines
   ending with `?`.

4. **README/license pagers**. The Applications CD prints a multi-page
   license agreement during scan. With `set page_output off` (step 4)
   the pager is auto-quit and *no* `q` keystroke is needed — sending
   `q` afterwards is interpreted as `quit` at the next prompt and pops
   you back to `Inst>` prematurely. Earlier versions of this guide
   recommended sending `q` after the Apps load; don't.
