# IRIS — SGI Indy (MIPS R4400) Emulator

## Quick start

```
prom.bin         # PROM image from a real Indy (or just use built in one)
scsi1.raw        # Hard disk image
cargo run --release
```

Connect the monitor console (a second terminal):
You have monitor console in the terminal or you can open extra ones telnetting to 127.0.0.1:8888

Serial ports are on ports 8880 and 8881 (connect to 8881 for IRIX serial term)

---

## First-time setup — Ethernet MAC address

The Indy stores its Ethernet MAC address in NVRAM (the DS1386 RTC chip).  A
fresh or blank `nvram.bin` has no address, which prevents networking from
working.  Set it once from the PROM monitor before booting IRIX:

1. Boot to the PROM monitor (press **Escape** and the **5** during the power-on countdown,
   or let it time out if no OS is present).

2. At the `>>` prompt, set the address:

   ```
   >> setenv -f eaddr 08:00:69:xx:xx:xx
   ```

   Use any valid SGI MAC (OUI `08:00:69`) or any locally-administered address.
   The value only needs to be unique on your virtual network, e.g.
   `08:00:69:de:ad:01`.

3. Save NVRAM from the IRIS monitor console (telnet 8888):

   ```
   rtc save
   ```

   This writes the current RTC/NVRAM state to `nvram.bin` in the working
   directory.  IRIS always loads `nvram.bin` automatically on startup, so
   the MAC address will persist across restarts.

4. Verify from IRIX after boot:

   ```
   # hinv | grep Ethernet
   # ifconfig ec0
   ```

---

## Network configuration

The emulator includes a built-in NAT gateway.  No host-side configuration is
required — it works out of the box once an Ethernet MAC address is set (see
above).

## Keyboard

Right control releases mouse grab.

**Right Ctrl + Print Screen** takes a screenshot (saved as `screenshot_NNNN.png` in the working directory).

### Addresses

Default addresses (see [Changing the subnet](#changing-the-subnet) if `192.168.0.x` conflicts with your LAN):

| Host | IP | Notes |
|------|----|-------|
| Gateway (emulated) | `192.168.0.1` | Responds to ARP and ICMP ping |
| Indy (guest) | `192.168.0.2` | Assigned via BOOTP/DHCP |
| Netmask | `255.255.255.0` | `/24` |

### DHCP / BOOTP

IRIX can obtain its IP address automatically.  The built-in gateway responds
to both BOOTP (plain) and DHCP (Discover/Request) on UDP port 67, and always
assigns host `.2` of the configured subnet (default `192.168.0.2`).

DHCP reply options provided:

| Option | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Subnet mask | `255.255.255.0` (or configured prefix) |
| Router | Gateway IP (default `192.168.0.1`) |
| DNS server | Host's upstream resolver (`8.8.8.8` by default) |
| Lease time | 86400 s (24 h) |

### NAT

All outbound TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic from the guest is NATed through the
host's network.

ICMP ping to the gateway IP is answered locally by the emulator (no host
network needed), so it always works.  DNS queries are forwarded to the host's
upstream resolver.

### Changing the subnet

If `192.168.0.x` conflicts with your local network, set `nat_subnet` in
`iris.toml` to any `/24` (or larger) network:

```toml
nat_subnet = "192.168.5.0/24"
```

The gateway always gets host `.1` and IRIX gets host `.2` within the chosen
subnet.  The change is purely internal — no host interface is created.  Prefixes
from `/8` to `/30` are accepted; `/24` is the typical choice.

You can also pass it on the command line:

```bash
iris --nat-subnet 192.168.5.0/24
```

### Port forwarding

You can forward host ports into the guest to reach IRIX services (telnet, ftp,
custom daemons, etc.) from the host or from the network.

Add one `[[port_forward]]` section per rule to `iris.toml`:

```toml
# Forward host TCP port 2323 → IRIX telnet (port 23), localhost only
[[port_forward]]
proto      = "tcp"
host_port  = 2323
guest_port = 23
bind       = "localhost"

# Forward host UDP port 2007 → IRIX echo (port 7), localhost only
[[port_forward]]
proto      = "udp"
host_port  = 2007
guest_port = 7
bind       = "localhost"

# Expose IRIX telnet on all interfaces (reachable from LAN)
[[port_forward]]
proto      = "tcp"
host_port  = 2323
guest_port = 23
bind       = "any"
```

| Field | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `proto` | `tcp`, `udp` | Protocol |
| `host_port` | 1–65535 | Port to listen on on the host |
| `guest_port` | 1–65535 | Port inside IRIX to forward to |
| `bind` | `localhost` (default), `any` | `localhost` = loopback only; `any` = all interfaces |

The emulator prints a line for each rule that binds successfully at startup:

```
iris: TCP port forward 127.0.0.1:2323 → guest:23
```

#### Testing

```bash
# TCP — telnet into IRIX
telnet localhost 2323

# UDP — send a datagram to the IRIX echo service (inetd must have echo enabled)
echo "hello" | nc -u -w1 localhost 2007
```

To check `/etc/inetd.conf` on IRIX for enabled services:

```sh
grep -v '^#' /etc/inetd.conf | grep -E 'tcp|udp'
```

## NFS file sharing

IRIS can export a host directory to IRIX over NFS using
[unfs3](https://github.com/unfs3/unfs3) as the NFS server.  The emulator
handles portmap (port 111) internally and NATs NFS/mountd traffic to a
localhost unfsd instance — no root privileges required.

### Requirements

Install unfs3 and make sure `unfsd` is in your `PATH`:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
apt install unfs3

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/unfs3/unfs3 && cd unfs3 && ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
```

### Configuration

Add an `[nfs]` section to `iris.toml`:

```toml
[nfs]
shared_dir = "./shared"       # directory to export (resolved to absolute path at startup)
# unfsd = "unfsd"             # path to unfsd binary [default: unfsd]
# nfs_host_port = 12049       # host port for NFS [default: 12049]
# mountd_host_port = 11234    # host port for mountd [default: 11234]
```

Or use the command-line flag to enable it without editing the config:

```bash
iris --nfs-dir /path/to/share
iris --nfs-dir /path/to/share --nfs-port 12049 --mountd-port 11234 --unfsd /usr/sbin/unfsd
```

IRIS will start unfsd automatically on launch and kill it on exit.  The shared
directory must exist before starting the emulator.

### Mounting from IRIX

The emulator prints the export path at startup:

```
iris: unfsd started (pid 1234) nfs=127.0.0.1:12049 mountd=127.0.0.1:11234 dir=/absolute/path/to/shared
```

From IRIX, mount using that absolute path:

```
# mkdir /shared
# mount 192.168.0.1:/absolute/path/to/shared /shared
# ls /shared
```

NFS version 3 is used by default; IRIX will fall back to version 2 automatically if needed.

### Checking network status from the monitor

```
net status           # show all NAT connections
net status tcp       # TCP connections only
net debug tcp on     # per-packet TCP trace
seeq status          # Ethernet MAC / DMA state
```

---

## Serial ports

The Z85C30 SCC provides two RS-232 serial channels, both exposed as TCP
sockets on localhost.  Connect with `telnet`, `nc`, or any raw TCP client.

| TCP port | SCC channel | IRIX device  | Physical connector |
|----------|-------------|------------- |--------------------|
| `8880`   | Channel A   | `/dev/ttyd2` | DB-9 RS-232 port (rear panel) |
| `8881`   | Channel B   | `/dev/ttyd1` | Mini-DIN serial / console fallback |

`/dev/ttyd1` is the Indy's primary serial console.  If the PROM `console`
variable is set to `d` (serial), all PROM and early-boot output goes to
`/dev/ttyd1` → TCP port **8881**.

### Connecting

```bash
# Attach to serial port 1 (ttyd1) in a separate terminal
telnet 127.0.0.1 8881

# Or with nc (avoids Telnet escape-sequence overhead)
nc 127.0.0.1 8881
```

### Monitor command

```
serial status    # dump SCC channel A/B register and FIFO state
```

## Configuration file — iris.toml

`iris.toml` is read from the current working directory on startup (override
with `--config`).  All paths are relative to that directory.

```toml
# PROM ROM image.
prom = "prom.bin"

# RAM bank sizes in MB.
# Valid values: 0 (absent), 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
# Typical Indy has two banks; banks 2 and 3 are 0.
banks = [128, 128, 0, 0]

# Window scale factor: 1 = native (1024×768), 2 = 2× for HiDPI/4K.
scale = 1

# Headless mode: no window, no REX3 graphics.
# Audio is unaffected — use no_audio to also disable HAL2.
headless = false

# Disable audio emulation (no HAL2 / no cpal).
# Independent of headless; can be combined freely.
no_audio = false

# SCSI devices.  Valid IDs: 1–7.
# For a hard disk, set cdrom = false.
[scsi.1]
path  = "scsi1.raw"
cdrom = false

# For a single-disc CD-ROM, set path only.
[scsi.4]
path  = "cdrom4.iso"
cdrom = true

# For a multi-disc changer, list all ISOs in `discs`.
# The first entry is mounted at startup; "scsi eject 4" cycles to the next.
# [scsi.4]
# path  = "irix65.iso"
# cdrom = true
# discs = ["irix65.iso", "extras.iso", "patches.iso"]

# VINO video-in (IndyCam emulation).
# source:   "test_pattern" | "camera" | "black"
# standard: "ntsc" | "pal"
# camera_index: which host camera (0 = default; only used when source="camera")
#
# source = "camera" requires building with `cargo build --features camera`.
# On macOS the first capture attempt triggers the system permission dialog;
# if you deny it (or no camera is attached) iris falls back to a black field
# so IRIX video drivers still attach cleanly.
[vino]
source       = "test_pattern"
standard     = "ntsc"
camera_index = 0
```

Looks like we have some problems automounting hybrid ISO9660 CDs like Hot Mix 19 while efs formatted ones and pure iso9660 seem to work fine.
mount -t iso9660 /dev/rdsk/dks0d4vol /CDROM seems to work though.
Somehow mediad and kernel are stepping on each other setting block size while the other does reads?

### SCSI ID conventions

| ID | Typical use |
|----|-------------|
| 1  | Internal hard disk (primary) |
| 2  | Second hard disk |
| 3  | Tape or additional disk |
| 4  | Internal CD-ROM |
| 5  | Additional CD-ROM |
| 6  | Additional disk or tape |
| 7  | (reserved for controller) |

## Snapshots

The emulator supports saving and restoring full machine state.  Snapshots
are stored as a directory of TOML + binary files.  Use the monitor `load` and `save`
commands.
